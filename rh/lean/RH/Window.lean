RH/Window.lean -- the retyped window structure and THE MASTER THEOREM
(r273 reviewer repair).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  The three former open statements
  * `terminal_crossratio_cofinal`   (pre-r273 Open.lean),
  * `prefix_resummation_positivity` (pre-r273 Open.lean),
  * `pair_margin_cofinal`           (pre-r273 PairBound.lean)
were quantified UNIVERSALLY over pure bookkeeping structures
(`WindowLadder`, an arbitrary `MainSource` predicate, `PairSplitFamily`)
and are therefore REFUTABLE by trivial models -- the explicit refutations
are machine-checked in RH/Counterexamples.lean.  The problem was never the
`sorry`; it was the missing definition of what a MAIN window IS.  This
file supplies
  (a) the concrete window structure `VonMangoldtWindow` that the real
      measured windows instantiate (exact rationals, as in the corpus),
  (b) the derived objects (moments, Hankel matrices `H_n`, chain `h_k`,
      border readouts `F_k`, Schur margins `D_n`, terminal cross-ratio
      `q`) as DEFINITIONS from the structure -- not as free fields,
  (c) the honestly-open source predicate `MainWindow` (opaque -- its
      mathematical content IS the open problem), and
  (d) the master theorem `augmented_prefix_positive`, from which BOTH
      former edges follow by finite matrix algebra.
      r305 UPDATE (wave 10): the master theorem and its corollaries
      MOVED to RH/Closure.lean, where the master is PROVED from the two
      true holes (`lstar_subordination` below + `terminal_positive_main`
      there) via the reconstruction theorem
      `lstar_terminal_implies_master` -- it is no longer an independent
      `sorry` of this file.

INSTANCE DATA (what the real windows would supply -- corpus dictionary):
  * `nodes`      -- the window node positions: the rescaled prime-power
                    abscissas `log p^k` of the von-Mangoldt double zone,
                    clipped to the window (probe coupledtau_probe.py,
                    r257, SPEC_SHA 73d8247f6de36a2b; frozen window spec).
                    NOTE: real abscissas are irrational; the corpus works
                    with the exact-rational frozen window data (f64 atoms
                    exactly converted, cf. r270 interval certificate).
  * `combWeight` -- the nonnegative von-Mangoldt comb masses (the mu side
                    of the signed defect measure mutilde = mu - nu).
  * `archWeight` -- the nonnegative archimedean/smooth subtraction (the
                    nu side; v955 window object, r224-r226).
  * `lo/hi/window_rule` -- the window rule: all nodes confined to the
                    frozen window interval (the Galerkin localization).
  * `u`          -- the border source vector (border column `t` of the
                    bordered RHP dictionary, v958 r244-r253; the r264
                    dictionary reads the terminal drive from it).
  * `B`          -- the budget scalar (r243 form: B = S_{N-2} + 5/7).
The half-filling cap is DERIVED: `cap = ceil(S/2) = (S+1)/2` (v956
half-filling law, r228-r229; counting half proved in RH/Inertia.lean as
`window_cap_arith`).

/-! ## The honest open predicate -/

/-- **`MainWindow` -- the honestly-open source predicate** (r273 retype).

This predicate is deliberately `opaque`: its mathematical content IS the
open problem.  What it must eventually say (the arithmetic properties any
proof of the master theorem has to consume):

  * the nodes/weights are the ACTUAL von-Mangoldt double comb of the
    window (`combWeight = Lambda(p^k)`-masses at `nodes = log p^k`
    rescaled, `archWeight` = the explicit archimedean density) -- i.e.
    genuine prime arithmetic, not just any nonneg-minus-nonneg split;
  * the border source `u` and budget `B` are the v958/r243 bordered-RHP
    data OF that comb (budget form `B = S_{N-2} + 5/7`);
  * whatever quantitative arithmetic input the wall needs: the measured
    content is quasi-definiteness of the signed defect measure exactly
    through half-filling (v956, r228-r229) and the coherent-cancellation
    depth of the ensemble (r259-r272).

What provably does NOT suffice (the measured kill lists, see
RH/Open.lean headers): every structural/bookkeeping consequence of the
fields above (Counterexamples.lean shows universality over the bare
structure is FALSE); mass majorants (r258); the bordered spectral bound
(r257/r265); saddle dominance / k-swap truncation (r259); subtraction-
free positivity, block involutions, transfer cones (r261); naive and
IIKS s-coordinates (r265); eventual-triangle asymptotics (r263); blind
level-2 pairing beyond 5/7 exception rungs (r270-r272).

Because `MainWindow` is opaque, no theorem conditioned on it can be
refuted by a toy model (truth-capability restored), and none can be
proved without supplying the arithmetic -- exactly the honest state.

C1 STATUS NOTE (the reviewer final-domain contract): since block C1
the LOAD-BEARING chain (the two true holes, the master theorem and
all its corollaries) no longer runs over this predicate -- it runs
over the constructive `CanonicalWindow` predicate of
RH/Canonical.lean (the completed canonical prime-window family; only
the kernel-channel VALUES stay opaque there, as the named constant
`canonicalCompletion`).  `MainWindow` remains as the r273 historical
interface: it is consumed only by the opacity bridge
`mainWindow_iff_builtFromPrimeSource` (RH/Source.lean) and documented
by the permanent guards. -/
opaque MainWindow : VonMangoldtWindow → Prop

/-! ## The master theorem (the new north star)

r305 MOVE (wave 10): the master theorem `augmented_prefix_positive`
(r273 target form -- for a MAIN window every augmented matrix
`A_{w,n} = [[H_n, u_n], [u_n^T, B]]` through the half-filling cap is
positive definite) now lives in RH/Closure.lean, where it is PROVED
from L* (`lstar_subordination` below) and the terminal statement
(`terminal_positive_main` there) via the reconstruction theorem
`lstar_terminal_implies_master`.  It carries NO `sorry` of its own
anymore: the open content is exactly the two true holes.  The `_main`
corollaries (`prefix_chain_positive_main`,
`terminal_margin_positive_main`, `terminal_crossratio_main`) moved
with it, proofs verbatim. -/

/-! ## Finite matrix algebra: everything derivable from the master
conclusion is proved here against the mathlib `Matrix.PosDef` API.
These lemmas take the PosDef conclusion as a hypothesis, so they are
unconditional finite algebra (no `sorry`); the `_main` corollaries
in RH/Closure.lean compose them with the master theorem. -/

/-! ## Wave 5 (rounds 279-281, v962): the fog-free central hole

The v962 theory set (`PRIME.WALL.HALFFILLING_PINNING_THEORY.01` [E],
module verification/v962_halffilling_pinning_theory.py) reduces the wall
to ONE placement question:
  * T1 (moment counting, r281 -- PROVED in RH/Inertia.lean as
    `moment_counting_free_pivots`): the free pivots are exactly
    `h_0 .. h_{cap-1}` -- half-filling is the end of the free moment
    space ("why half-filling" is answered by counting, no secret);
  * T2 (crossing budget, r279 -- stated in RH/Inertia.lean as
    `crossing_budget`, certified exactly in v962): the number of negative
    pivots over the full continuation is the negative-atom count `S_-`,
    world-blindly (Jacobi/Sylvester);
  * T4 (main window reduction -- `main_window_reduction` below, PROVED):
    "no crossing before the cap" is EXACTLY free-window positivity.
Hence nothing about the wall is open except WHERE the fixed budget is
spent, and that statement is `free_window_positivity` below. -/

/-! **THE FOG-FREE CENTRAL HOLE** (wave 5; the r279 b3 gap statement =
the v962 T4 reinstform; ledger
`PRIME.PORT.RHP.FULLSOURCE.QUASIDEFINITENESS.01` [O]): the statement
`free_window_positivity` is PROVED as a corollary of L* since wave 10
(r305) -- since C1 it lives in RH/Canonical.lean on the final domain
(`CanonicalWindow`), proved from `lstar_canonical`.  The v962

/-! ## Wave 6 (rounds 282-285, v963): the canonical form -- lemma L*

The r283 A2 chain (v963, `PRIME.LSTAR.REDUCTION_DICTIONARY.01` [E],
module verification/v963_lstar_reduction_dictionary.py) reduces the
free-window question to ONE two-measure subordination scalar, the
missing lemma L*: on a MAIN window, for every real polynomial `p != 0`
with `deg p < cap`,

    int p^2 dnu  <  int p^2 dmu

(equivalently `lambda_max(E_cap) < 1` for the nu-dressed mu-CD kernel;
the frame congruence `minor_k(D_mu - G) = D_k(mutilde)` and the
contraction equivalence are machine-certified exact-rationally in
v963).  Ledger: `PRIME.LSTAR.SUBORDINATION.01` [O]; the fully
standalone problem statement lives in rh/problem/lstar_problem.tex.

The direction L* => free-window positivity is PROVED below
(`lstar_implies_free_window`, via `lstar_implies_hankel_posDef`): the
subordination makes every Hankel block through the cap positive
definite (the quadratic form of the signed defect measure evaluated at
the coefficient polynomial), hence every Sylvester ratio `h_k` is
positive -- pure finite algebra, no `sorry`.  The statement itself is
the open center in canonical form and carries the honest `sorry` --
since C1 as `lstar_canonical` in RH/Canonical.lean (the final-domain
retype: quantified over the canonical construction, no longer over the
opaque `MainWindow`).  NO RH CLAIM. -/
