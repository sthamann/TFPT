RH/PairBound.lean -- the finite pair-bound theorem of the coupled-tau lane
(the r269/r271 fixed form c2PAIR as abstract finite algebra).

Provenance: round r271, contract PRIME.PORT.COUPLEDTAU.
UNIVERSAL_PAIR_THEOREM.01 (experiments only, no ledger row), probe
experiments/tfpt-discovery/universal_pair_theorem_probe.py
(SPEC_SHA 66f61c8a436af90e); the fixed form itself is the r269 winner
c2PAIR of phase_bulk_bound_probe.py (edge split F = 0.20 frozen, pairing
offset 0, no per-rung parameter).

THE OBJECT: the bulk remainder of the terminal border drive decomposes
into maximal same-sign runs; `l : List K` below is the list of EXACT
signed run sums `s_i` (machine ward r271 G21: `|s_i| = M_i` with `M_i`
the run mass, signs alternating).  The fixed pairing (offset 0) groups
adjacent runs into blocks; everything provable here is window-independent
finite algebra over a linearly ordered field -- exactly the layer the
r271 probe certifies numerically on 47 worlds (theorem validity, pair
identity, refinement chain, all exact).

Proved below (no `sorry`):
  * `blockSums_sum`     -- the exact pair-decomposition identity (i):
                           blocking preserves the total sum;
  * `abs_sum_le_absSum` -- the plain triangle |sum| <= sum of |.|;
  * `pairBound_eq`      -- pairBound = absSum after one blocking pass;
  * `abs_sum_le_pairBound`   -- the c2PAIR validity theorem (iii):
                           |sum l| <= pairBound l;
  * `pairBound_le_absSum`    -- the pairing never exceeds the abs
                           triangle (r269 G40 ward, exact);
  * `abs_sum_le_pairBound_level2` / `pairBound_level2_le` -- the r271
                           b2LEVEL2 refinement: valid and never worse;
  * `pair_exact`        -- the alternation pair identity (ii):
                           |sg*M1 - sg*M2| = |M1 - M2| for sg = +-1;
  * `boundary_triple_le` -- the r271 b1RAND boundary group is never
                           worse than pair + majorized tail.

The chain-specific hypothesis H5 (the certification margin
|Z_local| + eps < sqrt(5/7)) stays a documented `sorry` at the bottom --
it is the entry door of the cofinal step (r271 lemma list L1-L5),
measured 42/42 rungs only as 5/7 on the exception branch (c2PAIR;
b2LEVEL2 leaves kz39 at 0.002 dec and kz15 at 0.06 dec).  The `sorry` is
NOT a to-do of a known proof.
r273 RETYPE: the former universal form `pair_margin_cofinal` (quantified
over the bare `PairSplitFamily`) is REFUTABLE -- the machine-checked
guard is `Counterexamples.pair_margin_not_universal` (model M = 1,
Z = Zloc = 2, runs = []: H1-H4 hold with equality, the margin would need
2 < 1; H5 can never follow from H1-H4 because the structure carries no
arithmetic).  H5 is now typed on the concrete window structure as
`pair_margin_main` (VonMangoldtWindow + the honest opaque `MainWindow`
predicate of RH/Window.lean).
r320 RETYPE (the R319 audit finding U3): the r273 form of
`pair_margin_main` still quantified `(Zloc, runs)` FREELY (bound only
by the split inequality) and was thereby refutable against ANY main
window -- the r273 disease one level up; conserved old type
machine-refuted in `Counterexamples.old_pair_margin_forces_empty`.
Since r320 the extraction is a DEFINITION (`signRuns`/`terminalDrive`/
`bulkRuns`/`edgeLocal`, with the split a PROVED property,
`canonical_split`) and the margin law is stated for the canonical
extraction only.  The `sorry` census of this file is unchanged: ONE
(`pair_margin_main` -- the same open hole, now non-contradictory).

Claim boundary: research documentation.  NOT evidence for or against the
Riemann Hypothesis in either direction.  NO RH CLAIM.

/-! ## r320: the canonical (Zloc, runs) extraction as a DEFINITION
(the U3 repair)

THE U3 FINDING (R319 audit, kernel-verified reproducible): the r273
form of `pair_margin_main` left `(Zloc, runs)` FREELY QUANTIFIED,
bound only by the split inequality -- the r273 disease one level up.
Adversarial instantiation (`Zloc = |F| + 1`, `runs = []` -- the split
holds trivially) refuted the margin against ANY main window: the
statement type was inconsistent with `∃ w, MainWindow w`.  The
conserved old type is machine-refuted in RH/Counterexamples.lean
(`old_pair_margin_forces_empty`).

THE REPAIR: the extraction is now a DEFINITION from the window data,
and the split inequality is a PROVED PROPERTY of the canonical
extraction (`canonical_split`), not a hypothesis over free pairs.

HONEST MODELING SCOPE: the measured r271 extraction (G20/G23) operates
on the probe-side drive decomposition (the F = 0.20 mesh-cell edge
split of the bulk remainder), which lives BELOW the window interface
-- `VonMangoldtWindow` carries only the border column `u`.  The Lean
extraction therefore models the split on the available data: the bulk
sequence is the pre-terminal border column `u_0 .. u_{cap-2}`,
aggregated into maximal same-sign runs (`signRuns` -- the r271 G21 run
structure), and the local edge scalar is the EXACT complement
`Z - Σ runs` (so H1+H2, the exact edge/bulk split, holds by
construction).  The identification of this canonical extraction with
the probe-side F = 0.20 extraction is MEASURED (r271, 42/42 warded),
not formalized -- it belongs to the border transcription TODO
(`SourceExact`, RH/Source.lean). -/

/-- **H5, THE OPEN MARGIN LAW, retyped again** (r273 -> r320; the entry
door of the cofinal step).

Contract: PRIME.PORT.COUPLEDTAU.UNIVERSAL_PAIR_THEOREM.01 (r271,
experiments only -- no ledger row, no claim).

r273 RETYPE: the pre-r273 form `pair_margin_cofinal` quantified over the
bare `PairSplitFamily` and is FALSE as a universal
(`Counterexamples.pair_margin_not_universal` -- H1-H4 carry no
arithmetic from which H5 could follow).

r320 RETYPE (the R319 audit U3): the r273 form still quantified
`(Zloc, runs)` FREELY, bound only by the split hypothesis -- refutable
against any main window (guard:
`Counterexamples.old_pair_margin_forces_empty`).  The margin law is now
stated for the CANONICAL extraction (`edgeLocal w`, `bulkRuns w` --
definitions from the window data; the split is the proved
`canonical_split`): `w` a `VonMangoldtWindow`, `hw : MainWindow w` the
honest opaque source predicate (RH/Window.lean), the terminal drive
readout `Z = F_{cap-1}` from the window's border data (r263 dictionary
`Z_w = r_{N-1}`, `Z^2/m = q_N`), the budget `M` with `M^2 = 5/7` (the
r243 floor import L5).

Measured (42-rung ladder, r269/r271): the margin holds on 35 cheap
rungs + both mains via the r263 triangle certificate and on 5 of the 7
exception rungs via the fixed pair form (kz20/22/36/38/52); kz39 misses
by 0.002 dec and kz15 by 0.06 dec under the b2LEVEL2 refinement (0.01 /
0.18 dec under plain c2PAIR).  What a proof must supply is the r271
lemma list: L1 edge uniformity, L2 pair-sum decay (measured trend
currently sp(N, eps) = +0.67 -- the WRONG way for a naive decay; r272:
the L2 lemma needs a non-adjacent/global mechanism with delta' > 0.21 of
the available truth decay 0.45), L3 boundary vanishing, L4 run-structure
stability, L5 the 5/7 floor import.  The `sorry` IS the open problem --
