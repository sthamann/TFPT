## üì¶ What This Repository Contains

### üìì Notebooks

* **`TFPT_alpha_only_v1.ipynb`**

  A focused, narrative notebook that derives the fine structure constant from the cubic fixed point in one sitting. It includes the one parameter normal form in $c_3$, exact and approximate solvers, error analysis, and side-by-side checks against CODATA 2022.
* **`TFPT_Playground_v1_06.ipynb`**

  A richer, explorable notebook: slider-style inputs for $c_3$ and $\varphi_0$, plots for the cubic, sensitivity panels, and quick links to the E‚Çà ladder, inflation tiles, and two loop fingerprints.

### üõ† Tools

* **`Tools/E8ChainSolver/e8_orbit_engine`**

  A compact engine to build and traverse the E‚Çà nilpotent-orbit chain and to compute the log-exact ladder $\varphi_{n+1}=\varphi_n,\mathrm{e}^{-\gamma(n)}$.
  **Folders:**

  * `src/` ‚Äî core routines for the chain, damping $\gamma(n)$, and ladder values
  * `data/` ‚Äî source tables for orbit dimensions and labels
  * `tables/` ‚Äî precomputed ladder snapshots
  * `plots/` ‚Äî quick figures for reviews
  * `results/` ‚Äî cached numeric outputs used by the notebooks
  * `reports/` ‚Äî short, human-readable summaries of a run
  * `tests/` ‚Äî minimal checks for chain uniqueness and ratio invariants
  * `notebooks/` ‚Äî small dev notebooks for the engine
* **`GeneticAlgorithm/`**

  The search code that originally discovered the invariant patterns in candidate Lagrangians. Useful if you want to re-run the evolutionary search that converges on the same structural constants.
* **`Pyr@ate/`**

  Model files and exports for the two loop RGE runs with optional three loop SU(3) check. The YAML reflects the field content and thresholds used in the paper.

### üìÑ Papers & Documentation

  The complete reference: geometric derivation of $c_3$ and $\varphi_0$, the cubic fixed point for $\alpha$, the E‚Çà ladder, two loop fingerprints, inflation chapter, the chirality appendix, and a detailed changelog.
* **`TFPT Paper short.pdf`**

  A compressed narrative for quick reading and press contacts.

### üîß Build & Usage Files

* `pyproject.toml`,`setup.py` ‚Äî package metadata for editable installs

## üí° The Idea in One Page

TFPT claims that a handful of constants are not inputs but forced solutions of a stationary action across topology, geometry, and symmetry. Three pillars:

### 1. **Topology fixes the number**

$$
c_3 = \frac{1}{8\pi}
$$

via 11D Chern‚ÄìSimons reduction with integer intersection on $Y_7$. The same scale appears in ABJ-type terms. See Sections 3.2.1 and Appendix E.

### 2. **Geometry fixes the length**

$$
\varphi_0 = \frac{1}{6\pi} + \frac{3}{256\pi^4}

$$

from Gauss‚ÄìBonnet on the orientable double cover of the M√∂bius fiber, with a canonical $6\pi$ boundary coefficient and a universal topological add-on. See Sections 3.2.2 and Appendix D.

### 3. **Symmetry orders the scales**

The E‚Çà nilpotent-orbit chain $D_n=60-2n$ yields a log-exact damping $\gamma(n)$ and the ladder $\varphi_n$. Its initial value $\gamma(0)=0.834$ is set by an extremal smoothing principle on the chain and makes the ratio laws calibration-free. See Section 4.1 to 4.5 and Appendix B.

From these three, a cubic fixed point for the electromagnetic coupling follows:

$$
\alpha^3 - 2c_3^3\alpha^2 - 8b_1c_3^6\ln\frac{1}{\varphi_0} = 0, \quad b_1 = \frac{41}{10}

$$

which reproduces $\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.03650146$ within a few parts per million, with **no fitting** . See Sections 7.2 to 7.6.

Two loop RGE runs show fingerprints of the fixed points on the QCD flow: $\alpha_3$ meets $\varphi_0$ near one PeV and $c_3$ near $2.5 \times 10^8$ GeV, and the three inverse couplings form a narrow corridor around $10^{15}$ GeV. See Section 5.2 and the plots on pages 23 to 24.

There is also a compact inflation chapter that ties the same invariants to an alpha-attractor plateau with $r \sim 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$ at $N \approx 57$. See Section 6.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Create a fresh environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Install
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# 3) Sanity check
python run_demo.py  # prints the E8 chain, ratio tests, and a few ladder values
```

### Open the notebooks:

* **Alpha only** : Start with `TFPT_alpha_only_v1.ipynb`

  You will compute $\alpha$ from the cubic, compare to CODATA 2022, and try the high accuracy Newton update.
* **Playground** : Open `TFPT_Playground_v1_06.ipynb`

  Change $\varphi_0$ within sensible bounds and watch the self-consistency loop and sensitivity bars. The E‚Çà ladder and the cubic plots update together.

## üî¨ Reproduce Key Results

### 1. **One parameter normal form**

In the alpha notebook, evaluate the closed form with $c_3=1/(8\pi)$ and $\varphi_0=\frac{1}{6\pi}+\frac{3}{256\pi^4}$. The Cardano branch and the fast approximation both land in the ppm window. See Section 7.3 and 7.5.

### 2. **E‚Çà ladder ratios without any unit choice**

Run `run_demo.py` or the orbit engine to confirm:

```
œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ/œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = (36/40)^Œª
œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ/œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ = (30/36)^Œª
œÜ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÖ/œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ = (10/30)^Œª
```

with $\lambda = \gamma(0)/(\ln 248 - \ln 60)$. See Section 4.3.

### 3. **Two loop fingerprints**

Use the Pyr@ate model to run the flow and replicate the markers at one PeV and $2.5 \times 10^8$ GeV and the corridor near $10^{15}$ GeV. See Section 5.2.

## üéØ Design Choices

* **Everything is testable**

  The orbit engine exposes pure functions. Ratio laws and uniqueness of the chain are covered by unit tests.
* **Separation of concerns**

  Notebooks tell the story. Tools do the math. Papers justify the steps with references and proofs.
* **No fitting**

  Numbers come from topology, geometry, and group data. Where a unit is inevitable, it is a block-level calibration rather than a knob. See Sections 8.1 to 8.5.

---

## üîß How to Extend

### Add a new observable block

Define $(r_B, k_B, n_B)$, compute $\zeta_B = (\pi c_3),\mathrm{e}^{-\beta_B\pi c_3}\mathrm{e}^{-k_B/c_3}$ with $\beta_B = (8-r_B)/8$, and set $X_B = \zeta_B M_{\mathrm{Pl}}\varphi_{n_B}$. See Sections 8.1.1 and 8.1.2.

### Add a chain diagnostic

Use the engine's exported $\ln D_n$ to compute second differences and the extremal functional from Section 4.5, then compare $\gamma(0)$ against 0.834.

### Add a new flow scenario

Duplicate the Pyr@ate YAML, change threshold scales in one decade both ways, and record the corridor stability and the two fingerprints from Section 5.2.

## üåê How the Website Relates to This Code

The website uses the same formulas and tables:

* The**Alpha page** evaluates the cubic and shows the exact and approximate roots for the same $c_3$ and $\varphi_0$ as the paper.
* The**E‚Çà ladder widget** reads the same $D_n=60-2n$ chain and the identical log-exact $\gamma(n)$.
* The**RGE view** plots the corridor and the two fingerprints from the model in Pyr@ate.

If you want to align the site and the notebooks perfectly, run the orbit engine once and export `tables/ladder_v1_06.csv` for the site build.

## ‚ú® Final Note

> **If you only remember one thing, remember this: constants are not knobs. They are what remains when topology, geometry, and symmetry agree. The rest of this repo is a set of tools and proofs to make that statement reproducible.**
