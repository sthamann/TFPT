  PositiveDescentMaster — the kernel-checked abstract core of
  TFPT.POSITIVE_DESCENT.MASTER.01.
  ================================================================

  THE MASTER THEOREM CANDIDATE (frozen in the sibling probe
  `experiments/tfpt-discovery/positive_descent_master_probe.py`):
  finite operator systems with unital inclusions (1), positive
  states (2), CP transitions (3), a finite symmetry group with
  character sectors (4), SUMMABLE state defects (5), a
  sector-adapted closure datum (6), and a Mosco form family (7)
  yield a unique positive limit state whose compatible sector
  projections have well-defined positive limits.

  WHAT THIS MODULE PROVES (kernel-checked, no `sorry`).  The
  load-bearing core in the finite sector-weight form: states
  resolved over the character sectors of the finite abelian
  symmetry are vectors of nonnegative sector weights in
  `Fin m → ℝ` — exactly the data BOTH instances carry (G_net:
  m = 4 μ4-sectors; prime/packet: m = 128 characters of
  C2 × F2^4 × Z4, aggregated into 12 classes).  Then:

    (a) `exists_limit` / `limit_unique` / `tail_bound` —
        hypothesis (5) telescoping: summable defects make the
        state sequence Cauchy, a unique limit exists (finite
        products of ℝ are complete), and the quantitative Cauchy
        tail `dist (p n) q ≤ ∑' k, δ (n + k)` holds on every
        rung.  (Mathlib: `cauchySeq_of_dist_le_of_summable`,
        `dist_le_tsum_of_dist_le_of_tendsto`.)

    (b) `limit_nonneg` — hypothesis (2) is closed under the
        limit: coordinate evaluation is continuous, so
        nonnegative sector weights stay nonnegative in the limit.
        The MATRIX-state version (density matrices, PSD closed
        under entrywise limits) is the GramCompactness.lean
        legacy (`posSemidef_of_tendsto`), cited not re-proved.

    (c) `sector_tendsto` / `master_core` — hypothesis (4)
        commutes with the limit: sector aggregation (any finite
        set of characters) is a finite sum of continuous
        evaluations, so sector weights converge to the sector
        weights of the limit, and each limit sector is
        nonnegative.  `mu4_char_sum` records the μ4 orthogonality
        head Σ_{j<4} i^j = 0 (the exactness token for the
        character projectors used by both instances).

  WHAT IS TYPED, NOT PROVED HERE (honest split).  The
  noncommutative upgrade (states as functionals on C*-algebras,
  GNS, normality), the CP structure of the transitions (3) — the
  probe verifies it numerically via Choi matrices / convex-update
  identities — and the closure data (6), (7).  Hypotheses (6)/(7)
  are NOT consumed by (a)–(c); they feed the later per-instance
  analytic steps.  No continuum theorem and no RH statement is
  formalized or claimed.
