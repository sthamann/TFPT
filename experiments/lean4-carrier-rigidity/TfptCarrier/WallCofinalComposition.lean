  WallCofinalComposition — plugging the certified finite head into
  the cofinal Weil implication.
  =================================================================

  This module composes the kernel-checked per-rung certificates of
  WallLadderChecker (the exported v897 wall matrices, each proven
  positive definite by `decide` in the Lean kernel) with the minimal
  H theorem `CofinalWeil.cofinal_weil`.  It is the FORMAL SEAM between
  the finite head of the prime-front wall and the RH-side geography —
  stated so that every remaining gap is a NAMED hypothesis, never
  papered over.

  WHAT THIS MODULE PROVES (kernel-checked, no `sorry`, no
  `native_decide`, no axioms):

    (1) `posSemidef_of_bridge` — a true ladder matrix that dominates
        (in the PSD order) a nonnegative multiple of a certified PD
        certificate matrix is itself PSD.  This is the lemma through
        which a kernel-checked integer certificate lifts to the true
        analytic rung.

    (2) `head_psd_of_enclosure` — the finite-head composition: the
        per-rung kernel certificates (a list `ds`) plus the per-rung
        enclosure bridges give PSD of the TRUE ladder matrices at
        every head position `j < ds.length`.

    (3) `cofinalHypothesis_of_head_tail` — finite head + named tail
        assemble into exactly `CofinalWeil.CofinalHypothesis` (H_cof),
        the one positivity input of the cofinal Weil implication.

    (4) `wall_cofinal_weil` — the end-to-end composition: certified
        head + `HeadEnclosure` + `TailPositivity` + per-element form
        convergence ⇒ the full conclusion of `cofinal_weil` (cofinal
        nonnegativity, convergence along the ladder, and QW ≥ 0 on
        the dense family).

  THE HONEST BOUNDARY — the two NAMED HYPOTHESES this module is
  about (deliberately hypotheses, NOT theorems):

    * `HeadEnclosure` — the interval-enclosure identification: the
      true rung-j wall matrix dominates Q⁻¹ times the exported
      integer certificate matrix.  This is EXACTLY the v897 E1–E4
      error accounting (node-enclosure lemma, outward-rounded
      archimedean layer, tent-atom rigour, and the rigorous shift
      shift_int = h + ⌈2·h·rad_max·Q⌉ giving
      K_true ⪰ (N − shift·1)/Q).  It is carried by the Python
      interval arithmetic of verification/v897_*.py and is NOT
      re-proven in Lean — no analytic ladder assembly is formalized
      here.

    * `TailPositivity` — everything beyond the kernel-checked head:
      the reachable rungs not (yet) kernel-checked AND the entire
      asymptotic tail h → ∞.  No finite table can discharge it
      (`ExcessSkeleton.pointwise_pos_not_uniform` is the kernel-checked
      reminder); it stays with the registered port contracts
      (PRIME.PORT.TAIL.01 / PRIME.PORT.LEADING.SIGN.01).

  NO RH claim.  `cofinal_weil` is an implication with (H_cof) as
  input; this module shrinks the unproven part of (H_cof) by the
  kernel-checked head and NAMES what remains.

`B` dominates `Q⁻¹` times the exported integer certificate matrix (up
to the index identification `e`).  This is v897's E4 error accounting
`K_true ⪰ (N − shift·1)/Q`, external to Lean. -/

section Ladder

variable {κ : ℕ → Type*} [∀ m, Fintype (κ m)]

/-- **NAMED HYPOTHESIS (the head identification)**: each of the first
`ds.length` ladder rungs (ascending h, the certified prefix of the
v897 census) satisfies the enclosure bridge against its exported
certificate.  Backed by the v897 interval arithmetic — NOT proven in
Lean. -/

    EnclosureBridge (A (idx j)) (ds.get ⟨j, hj⟩)

/-- **NAMED HYPOTHESIS (the remaining wall)**: PSD of the true ladder
matrices at every rung index `≥ J` — the reachable rungs not (yet)
kernel-checked AND the whole asymptotic tail h → ∞.  This is the open
part of (H_cof); no finite table can discharge it. -/

bridges force PSD of the TRUE ladder matrices on the whole head. -/

/-- **HEAD + TAIL = (H_cof)**: the certified finite head and the named
tail hypothesis assemble into exactly the `CofinalHypothesis` that
`CofinalWeil.cofinal_weil` consumes.  The ladder `idx` is pre-fixed

/-! ### (4) The end-to-end theorem -/

/-- **WALL COFINAL WEIL** — the module's final theorem, the full
composition chain:

  kernel-checked per-rung certificates (hcert; `decide` on exported
  v897 data)  +  `HeadEnclosure` (NAMED: the v897 interval-enclosure
  identification)  +  `TailPositivity` (NAMED: everything beyond the
  checked head)  +  per-element form convergence

  ⇒  the conclusion of `CofinalWeil.cofinal_weil`: nonnegative ladder
  values on all rungs of the pre-fixed ladder, convergence along it,
  and nonnegativity of the limit functional on the dense family.

Only the two NAMED hypotheses and form convergence remain unproven —
the finite head itself is closed by the kernel. -/
