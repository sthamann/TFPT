  CofinalWeil — the minimal H theorem: cofinal positivity suffices.
  ================================================================

  The MINIMAL load-bearing statement of the extraction chain (work
  package F1, 2026-08-07 evening plan), REPLACING the over-strong
  `UniformMarginBound` of ExcessSkeleton in the RH-side geography.
  Numeric counterpart: `experiments/tfpt-discovery/
  continuum_extraction_probe.py` (PRIME.EXTRACTION.CHAIN.01, run 2,
  19/19 PASS, verdict EXTRACTION-CHAIN-COMPLETE): the implication
  chain needs NO Mosco compactness, NO uniform delta, NO diagonal
  argument — per-element convergence of the ladder forms plus
  positivity along ONE pre-fixed cofinal ladder already forces the
  limit functional to be nonnegative on the dense family.

  WHAT THIS MODULE PROVES (kernel-checked, no `sorry`, no
  `native_decide`).

    (1) `CofinalHypothesis` — THE COFINAL HYPOTHESIS (H_cof): a
        PRE-FIXED strictly monotone index sequence m_j → ∞ along
        which the ladder matrices are PSD.  The index sequence is a
        FIELD of the structure — it enters as data fixed in advance,
        never mined from measured signs (the preregistration
        demand; see the doc comment on `idx`).

    (2) `limit_nonneg_of_cofinal_seq` — THE MINIMAL IMPLICATION at
        sequence level: q_m(v) → L and q_{m_j}(v) ≥ 0 on the ladder
        force L ≥ 0.  This IS the ε/2 argument
        (L = lim_j q_{m_j}(v) ≥ 0), packaged as
        `ge_of_tendsto'` along the subsequence — PROVEN, not
        assumed.  `weil_nonneg_of_cofinal` — the same for a whole
        dense family: per-element convergence of the ladder forms
        to the limit functional + (H_cof) ⇒ the limit functional is
        nonnegative on the WHOLE dense family.  No diagonal
        argument appears: the same cofinal ladder serves every
        element simultaneously (matrix PSD is uniform in the
        witness).

    (3) THE RELATION LEMMAS — the strict hierarchy, kernel-checked:
          `uniformMarginBound_to_cofinal`   (uniform ⇒ cofinal),
          `pointwise_to_cofinal`            (all-rung ⇒ cofinal),
          `cofinal_not_uniform`             (cofinal ⇏ uniform,
                                             witness 1/(m+1) via
                                             ExcessSkeleton.pointwise_pos_not_uniform),
          `cofinal_not_pointwise`           (cofinal ⇏ all-rung,
                                             witness ±1 on the even
                                             ladder).
        Together with `ExcessSkeleton.uniformMarginBound_pos` and
        `ExcessSkeleton.pointwise_pos_not_uniform`:
        uniform ⊊ pointwise ⊊ cofinal — the old hypothesis is
        STRICTLY stronger, twice over.

    (4) `cofinal_weil` — the assembly: ladder matrices + sampling
        maps + per-element form convergence + (H_cof) ⇒ nonnegative
        ladder values on the cofinal rungs, convergence along the
        ladder, and nonnegativity of the limit functional on the
        dense family.

  WHAT IS ABSENT — BY DESIGN (the point of the theorem; the
  acceptance list of F1).  The hypotheses of `cofinal_weil` contain:
    * NO uniform margin (no `UniformMarginBound`, no δ > 0),
    * NO inverse matrix and no resolvent,
    * NO Mosco convergence and no coercivity,
    * NO limit operator — only the limit VALUES QW(v) appear;
      no operator on any limit space is constructed or assumed,
    * NO diagonal argument — the quantifier order is
      ∀ element ∃ limit, with ONE ladder for all elements.
  Only three inputs remain: the dense family (as an abstract index
  type — density itself and the C⁰-continuity extension to all test
  functions are the two elementary classical lemmas of the probe's
  synthesis, typed there as citations, deliberately NOT formalized
  here), per-element form convergence (Piece 2, measured rates
  −1.58..−1.84 per level), and cofinal positivity (H_cof — the
  arithmetic wall, and nothing else).

  THE HONEST BOUNDARY.  (H_cof) is the named hypothesis this module
  is ABOUT — it stays a hypothesis everywhere; nothing here proves,
  gates, or even evaluates positivity of any actual tower form.
  Relation to the ExcessSkeleton boundary: `UniformMarginBound`
  implies (H_cof) (`uniformMarginBound_to_cofinal`) and the converse
  fails kernel-checked (`cofinal_not_uniform`) — the wall content
  has strictly decreased.  No continuum theorem, no RH statement, no
  arithmetic identification is formalized or claimed here.

input of the extraction chain: a pre-fixed strictly monotone index

PREREGISTRATION DEMAND: the sequence `idx` must be chosen
INDEPENDENTLY of any measured signs — it is a field of this
structure, fixed before any form value is evaluated, never mined
from the data.  (Formally `idx` is data, not an existential: a
consumer must exhibit the ladder first and the positivity
certificates second.)  This replaces the over-strong
`ExcessSkeleton.UniformMarginBound`: no uniform margin δ > 0 is
demanded, only PSD at the ladder rungs. -/

/-- **THE MINIMAL IMPLICATION, sequence level** — the ε/2 argument,
proven: if the form values converge, q_m(v) → L, and are
nonnegative along a strictly monotone ladder, q_{m_j}(v) ≥ 0, then
the limit is nonnegative: L = lim_j q_{m_j}(v) ≥ 0.  No uniform
margin, no rate, no monotonicity of the values — cofinal
nonnegativity plus convergence alone. -/

ALL-RUNG STRICT — positivity does NOT give a uniform margin bound.

weaker than `UniformMarginBound`: replacing the latter by the former
is a genuine reduction of the wall. -/

all-rung nonnegativity — witness ±1 on the even ladder idx j = 2j

/-- **COFINAL WEIL** — the module's final theorem, the minimal
extraction statement with the logical geography kernel-checked.
Given ladder matrices, sampling maps, per-element form convergence
on the dense family, and the ONE named hypothesis (H_cof):

  * PROVEN: the ladder forms are nonnegative at every cofinal rung
    for every element; the forms converge along the ladder; the
    limit functional is nonnegative on the whole dense family.
  * ABSENT BY DESIGN: uniform margins, inverses, Mosco coercivity,
    limit operators, diagonal arguments — none is needed, none
    appears.

Only density, form convergence, and cofinal positivity enter — the
measured quantifier reduction of EXTRACTION-CHAIN-COMPLETE, as a
kernel-checked implication. -/
