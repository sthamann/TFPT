r"""lstar_parity_section_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.PARITY_SECTION.01
(round 336): the CHEBYSHEV TOEPLITZ+HANKEL PARITY SECTION of L* --
the reviewer's rank-3 language, the last pre-authorized L* arm
after r334 structurally capped the capacity route.  L* (the open
scalar of r283/r284/r286: lambda_max(E_{N_w}) < 1 for the
nu-dressed mu-CD kernel, margin 1.6752e-4 on w9, crossing exactly
at minC + 1 = 185) is re-read in the Chebyshev coordinate: map the
window hull affinely onto [-1, 1], set x = cos theta; every real
polynomial with deg p < N is p(cos theta) = sum_{k<N} a_k cos(k
theta), and with the COSINE MOMENTS of the signed source
    c_r = sum_j (mu_j - nu_j) cos(r theta_j)
the EXACT identity
    int p^2 d(mu - nu) = sum_{k,l<N} a_k a_l (c_{|k-l|} + c_{k+l})/2
holds -- THE L* MATRIX IS A FINITE TOEPLITZ+HANKEL PARITY SECTION
M_N = (T_N + H_N)/2, congruent (exact rational congruence M =
S (V_+^T T_M(c) V_+) S, S = diag(1, 1/2, ..., 1/2), M = 2N - 1) to
the EVEN parity compression of the full symmetric Toeplitz section
-- the mirror object of the v549/v550 (T150/T151) machinery, where
the ODD compression U_-^T T U_- = T - H carried the certified
grid step-over: a pointwise NEGATIVE symbol with a POSITIVE parity
section because the negative symbol zone [0, theta_c) sits below
the first active parity grid point (the methodological template
this round transcribes to the L* side).  THE ROUND'S THREE KILL
TESTS, sealed (reviewer verbatim -- the lane stays open only if
ALL THREE carry): (1) the Chebyshev T+H representation is
bit-exact (exact Fractions on a small rational window, f64 <=
1e-12 on w9 + a ladder sample); (2) MAIN and the rational twin
have a parity-specific negative window geometry that the four
dead controls do NOT have (negative symbol zones, first active
parity frequency, their distance -- world-comparative under the
sealed r281 distance rule); (3) a SOURCE-PURE distance scalar
(negative symbol zone <-> first active parity mode) predicts the
L* flip WITHOUT reading h_n or lambda_max (blind predictor on the
42-rung ladder + the four controls; AST audit against target
read-back).  NOT a proof round: no L* claim, no bound mechanism,
no certificate -- machinery + census + honest typing.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO promotion,
NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO RH CLAIM in either direction.

THE SYMBOL CONVENTION (sealed): the finite symbol at truncation R
is f_R(theta) = c_0 + 2 sum_{r=1}^{R} c_r cos(r theta) on [0, pi]
(the Dirichlet partial sum of the folded signed measure in the
mapped angle); the section of size n consumes exactly the moments
r <= R(n) = 2(n - 1), so its form is int q f_{R(n)} dtheta/(2 pi)
with q = p(cos theta)^2 >= 0 of trigonometric degree <= R(n): the
truncation is EXACT for the section, not an approximation.  THE
ACTIVE PARITY GRID (sealed at design time, disclosed): theta_k =
pi k / n, k = 1..n-1 (k = 0 and k = n excluded -- the step-over
convention of the T151 template: the grid never contains theta =
0); the first active parity frequency is theta_1 = pi/n.  THE
FEJER VARIANT (C2 clause ii, the reviewer's Fejer mean): sigma_R
f(theta) = c_0 + 2 sum (1 - r/(R+1)) c_r cos(r theta) -- the
Fejer kernel is NONNEGATIVE, so a negative Fejer reading is a
genuine net-negative local signed mass at resolution ~ pi/n,
never a Gibbs artifact; the PRIMARY sealed predictor is therefore
the Fejer variant (disclosed design choice), the Dirichlet-reading
variant is carried as the sealed SECONDARY column, both frozen
before evaluation:
    n_pred = first n in [2, 2 N_w + 8] with
             min_{k=1..n-1} sigma_{R(n)} f(pi k / n) < 0
(source-pure: consumes the c_r sequence only, i.e. atom positions
+ signed weights; never h_n, never a spectrum).  DISCLOSED
PRE-FREEZE RANGE EXTENSION: the scan cap was widened from N_w + 8
to 2 N_w + 8 after smoke pass 1 showed the w9 Fejer floor still
positive at N_w + 8 (a truncated None is a worse measurement than
a located late firing); the extension happened BEFORE the freeze
and BEFORE any full evaluation; no bar, band, grid or typing rule
moved.

INDEX FIREWALL (binding, r238-r334 discipline): w = window, S =
#union atoms, S_+/S_- = #mu/#nu atoms, N_w = (S+1)//2 = builder
depth, minC = first n with h_n < 0, crossing = minC + 1 (the r283
monotone-loading theorem, consumed as the crossing dictionary on
the ladder; controls re-measured spectrally); theta_j = arccos of
the affinely mapped union atom, c_r = the signed cosine moments.
Ground truth (r283/r284/r334 records, control flips, census
offsets) enters GATES and record tables only; the sealed
constructors consume position/weight/moment arrays ONLY (AST
scope audit); no zero/prime oracles anywhere (AST firewall); the
predictor and every symbol statistic are world-blind (NO
eigenvalue, NO sign chain, NO withheld record in any constructor
-- enforced by the scope audit; the m2/m4 mutants prove the audit
bites).  MACHINERY IMPORTED VERBATIM: document pipeline

LEG 0 -- ANCHORS: w9 records through the document pipeline
(S = 367 = 263 + 104, N_w = 184, lambda_max(E_184) = 0.99983248,
lambda at 185 = 1.00003660, margin 1.6752e-4); the campaign
channel cross-gate (BL union == V union at 1e-9 rel, minC = 184);
the r284 shallow edge (the two smallest-theta nu atoms are folds
2 and 4 -- gated, and their position printed against the measured
negative zones); the r334 coordinate 1 - kappa_int as a SEALED
COMPARISON COLUMN (record values 4.8e-4 / 4.3e-4 / 2.6e-5 / 9e-6
at kz18/kz9/kz60/kz52 -- reporting only, never recomputed, never
consumed).

LEG A -- THE EXACT REPRESENTATION (C1, kill test 1): (a1) exact
rational toy (7 union atoms, hull [-3/4, 3/4] STRICTLY inside
[-1, 1], asymmetric weights, sealed below): the T+H identity in
EXACT Fractions (Chebyshev recurrence, mapped hull), bit-equal;
(a2) the parity dilatation EXPLICIT and exact: M == S (V_+^T
T_7(c) V_+) S elementwise in Fractions (V_+ the unnormalized even
parity columns e_0, e_{+k} + e_{-k}; S = diag(1, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2)),
and the ODD compression documented beside it ((V_-^T T V_-)_{kl}
== 2(c_{|k-l|} - c_{k+l}) exactly -- the v549 T-H object, NOT the
L* matrix); (a3) f64 identity on w9 for the sealed coefficient
family (Chebyshev unit coefficients d in {1, 2, 3, N/2, N-1} + 3
deterministic golden draws), rel dev <= 1e-12 against the
absolute-mass scale; the same on the ladder sample (first /
median / last rung, reduced family); (a4) the FFT mode-reading
cross-route (rfft of the padded moment vector == direct cosine
sums) exact to 1e-13 on the toy and 1e-11 on w9 at n = 20 / 120 /
184; (a5) the section flip: min eig M_184 > 0 >= min eig M_185
(within the disclosed f64 resolution ||M|| 1e-12; the PD
statement itself is carried by the r283-gated crossing 185, not
by raw f64 eigenvalues -- disclosed).

LEG B -- THE SYMBOL ANATOMY (C2 pre-stage, kill test 2): per
world at its OWN N_w and R(N_w) = 2(N_w - 1): the negative zones
of f_{R} on [0, pi] (sealed fine grid 8192 + 60-step bisection at
every sign change), the active parity grid pi k / N_w, and the
four sealed world statistics
  K_P1 = total negative-zone measure / pi,
  K_P2 = #active modes inside negative zones (the geometric
         Schur count),
  K_P3 = the Fejer floor min_k sigma_R f(pi k/N_w) / c_0,
  K_P4 = min distance from any negative zone to the active grid
         in units of the mode spacing pi/N_w (None if no zones);
worlds: MAIN + rational TWIN (live) vs EPST / SCR / SMOOTH / HL2
(dead, built verbatim through the r278/r280/r284 channel, minC ==
flips 25/21/27/25 gated); adjudication by the sealed r281
distance rule (MAIN_SEPARATING iff MAIN's value is farther from
EVERY dead value than the dead spread) => PARITY_WORLD_SEEN /
PARITY_WORLD_BLIND.

LEG C -- THE BLIND PREDICTOR (kill test 3): the sealed scan
(PRIMARY Fejer, SECONDARY Dirichlet, both frozen) on the 42
frame-A rungs (h <= 900, r281 census channel re-gated: offset
distribution == r281, anchors exact, half-filling 42/42; crossing
= minC + 1 by the r283 theorem) + the four controls (crossing
re-measured spectrally at depth 40, == flip + 1); sealed band
test |log2(n_pred / crossing)| <= 1.0 on ALL 46 worlds (a None
prediction counts as a break) => PREDICTOR_LAW; else spearman
(n_pred, crossing) >= 0.75 over the worlds with finite n_pred =>
PREDICTOR_ORDERING (with the r284 honesty clause when the
controls fail the band -- the ordering then rides the trivial N_w
scaling); else PREDICTOR_REFUTED (break loci printed).  The
STEP-OVER CLAUSES at n = N_w on MAIN and TWIN: (i) no active mode
inside any negative zone (K_P2 == 0), OR (ii) the Fejer mean is
positive on all active modes (K_P3 > 0) => the verdict token
NEGATIVE_WINDOW_STEP_OVER with the fired clause(s) named.

LEG D -- THE SCHUR BLOCK SKETCH (C3, measurement only): per world
and per ladder rung at n = N_w: the block size = #active modes
with negative Dirichlet reading and #active modes with negative
Fejer reading (how many deep modes a fixed finite Schur block
would need), and the REST FLOOR = min Fejer reading over the
modes OUTSIDE the Fejer-negative block, normalized by c_0 (is the
remainder source-purely positive?) -- census over the 42 rungs,
block-size distribution and floor signs printed; no bound is
claimed from it.

LEG E -- WARDS / MUST-FAILS (each loud): (m1) T+H WITH THE WRONG
PARITY CONVOLUTION: the odd-sector matrix (c_{|k-l|} - c_{k+l})/2
must break the exact toy identity (Fractions, difference exactly
nonzero) -- CAUGHT; (m2) PREDICTOR READS THE TARGET: a mutant
orienting n_pred by the withheld lambda record is FLAGGED by the
AST scope audit; (m3) SYMBOL ON THE UNNORMALIZED WINDOW: cosine
moments taken at arccos of the UNMAPPED atoms (hull strictly
inside [-1, 1]) mixed with the mapped basis must break the exact
toy identity (Fractions, difference exactly nonzero) -- CAUGHT;
(m4) FEJER ORDER BY SIGHT: a mutant scanning Fejer orders against
the withheld crossing until the floor turns positive is FLAGGED
by the AST scope audit.  STOP LIST (anti-gates, binding): NO L*
claim, NO bound mechanism, NO step-over promoted as a
certificate, NO posthoc grid or truncation variant, NO derived
5/7, NO RH claim; r243..r335 stand.

scopes + mutants + w9 f64 block (records, channel gate, identity,
section flip, FFT cross-route, anatomy, w9 predictor); ladder,
controls, twin, world rule and adjudication skipped.  PRE-SPEC
SCOPING (disclosed): the r283/r284/r334 record numbers (S counts,
lambda records, flips, census offsets, shallow-edge folds, the
1 - kappa_int column) are consumed as sealed gate anchors and
comparison prints only; the symbol convention (Dirichlet partial
sum at R(n) = 2(n-1)), the active grid pi k/n with both endpoints
excluded, the Fejer-primary predictor, the four world statistics,
the distance rule, every bar/tolerance, the mutants and the
verdict form were fixed at design time from the published record
geometry BEFORE any machinery pass of this probe; no bar, band,
grid or typing rule was tuned after any evaluation of this probe.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+'):
  [exactly one of] PARITY_FINITESECTION_CARRIER(w9 + twin: the
    finite symbol attains negative values at R(N_w) while the
    N_w section is PD through the r283-gated crossing -- the
    positivity is a genuine finite-section effect) /
    SYMBOL_RESTATEMENT(named reason: the symbol is pointwise
    nonnegative on the live worlds -- nothing is stepped over,
    the section form merely restates positivity)
  + [exactly one of] NEGATIVE_WINDOW_STEP_OVER(fired clauses i /
    ii on MAIN and TWIN at n = N_w) / NO_STEP_OVER(loci)
  + [exactly one of] PARITY_WORLD_SEEN(separating stats) /
    PARITY_WORLD_BLIND
  + [exactly one of] PREDICTOR_LAW(max band dev) /
    PREDICTOR_ORDERING(spearman; honesty clause) /
    PREDICTOR_REFUTED(break loci)
  + SCHUR_LEDGER(block census + rest-floor signs) [always].
Honesty before beauty: the T+H identity and the parity dilatation
are EXACT COORDINATES of the open scalar L*, not a proof; a
passing step-over clause is a measured geometric fact at one
degree, not a positivity mechanism; a passing predictor band is a
falsifiable crossing FORMULA, not a theorem; the Schur ledger is
a size measurement, no block is constructed; no verdict claims
L*, a bound mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any
direction.

RECORD TABLES: to be frozen from the record run (two-commit
protocol: the PRE-FREEZE commit carries the spec + machinery
WITHOUT record tables; the record commit inserts the measured
tables verbatim, chronology honest -- smoke passes, calibration
pass, any disclosed calibration amendment, then run1/run2).

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
