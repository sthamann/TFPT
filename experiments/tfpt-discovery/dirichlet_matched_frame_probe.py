r"""dirichlet_matched_frame_probe --
PRIME.WORLD.DIRICHLET_MATCHED_FRAME.01 (round 357): THE
GRH-FAITHFUL DIRICHLET FRAME -- the missing second arithmetic,
reviewer rank 2 after the r355 substance condition.

CONTEXT (binding).  R330 (dirichlet_secondworld_probe,
SECOND_WORLD_SPLITS) twisted the SOURCE ATOMS ONLY inside the MAIN
frame: the archimedean lags, the smooth border and every constant
stayed zeta's -- the Gamma-factor parity and the conductor of
L(s, chi) were NOT modeled (disclosed there as the honest limit).
Result: the half-filling wall died at control depth (w9 DIR nf 24
/ ABS nf 37 vs MAIN nf None), the r306 pointwise C_2 broke by up
to 149x, sigma grew, the O-sign class flipped -- but the round
COULD NOT distinguish "wall is zeta-specific" from "wall needs the
matched frame".  That distinction is THIS round (the r338-U5 named
successor, demanded by both lanes since; reviewer fork verbatim:
"Dirichlet-Frame priorisieren ... echte zweite Arithmetik ...
wenn dieselben Mechanismen dort tragen, gewinnt ihr massiv an
Universalitaet; wenn nicht, wisst ihr sofort, was MAIN-spezifisch
ist").

LEG 0 -- THE FRAME DERIVATION (sealed FIRST, the core).  For a
primitive Dirichlet character chi mod q with parity a =
(1 - chi(-1))/2 the completed L-function is
    Lambda(s, chi) = (q/pi)^((s+a)/2) Gamma((s+a)/2) L(s, chi),
entire for chi != chi_0 (NO pole term -- and none exists in the
frame: the window density is arch lags + prime lags only).  The
Weil explicit formula for L(s, chi) has
  PRIME SIDE: the chi-weighted von Mangoldt comb Lambda(n) chi(n)
    (for the real characters mod 3 / mod 4 the weights stay REAL
    but sign-modulated; chi(n) = 0 atoms drop; positions log n and
    the v563 gauge 2 Lambda(n)/sqrt(n) unchanged -- the r330 comb,
    reused bitwise);
  ARCHIMEDEAN SIDE: 2 (d/ds) log[(q/pi)^((s+a)/2) Gamma((s+a)/2)]
    at s = 1/2 + i xi, i.e. the matched arch density
      F_A^chi(xi) = -log(pi/q) + Re psi((1+2a)/4 + i xi/2)
    (zeta: -log pi + Re psi(1/4 + i xi/2), the r342 dictionary).
  LAG SPACE: with the Gauss integral psi(z) = -gamma +
    2 int_0^inf [e^{-2w} - e^{-2wz}]/(1 - e^{-2w}) dw and z =
    (1+2a)/4 + i xi/2 (so e^{-2wz} = e^{-(1/2+a)w} e^{-i xi w}),
      Re psi((1+2a)/4 + i xi/2) = -gamma
        + 2 int_0^inf [e^{-2w} - cos(xi w) e^{-(1/2+a)w}]
                      / (1 - e^{-2w}) dw,
    hence the matched tent-sampled arch lag function is EXACTLY
    the document body (lstar_problem / verify_lstar_instance
    arch_A_far / arch_A_near) with TWO swaps:
      kernel  e^{-w/2}      ->  e^{-(1/2+a)w}      (parity)
      const  -(gamma+log pi) -> -(gamma+log(pi/q))  (conductor)
    (the e^{-2w} regulator and the truncation-tail term are
    parity/conductor-free and stay verbatim); the truncation tail
    of the dictionary generalizes to a_k = 2k + 1/2 + a.  At
    (a = 0, q = 1) the construction MUST reproduce zeta's arch
    layer BITWISE -- gated.
  CHARACTERS: chi mod 3 (odd, a = 1, the r330 character, comb
    cross-warded bitwise against DSW.dirichlet_comb) = PRIMARY
    WORLD; chi mod 4 (odd, a = 1, drops the 2^k atoms) = second
    probe, census.
  R330 DIVERGENCE LEDGER (what was NOT matched there, now is):
    (i) conductor term log(q/pi) -- ABSENT in r330, PRESENT here;
    (ii) Gamma parity a = 1 (psi at 3/4, kernel e^{-3w/2}) --
    ABSENT, PRESENT; (iii) the smooth-comb border companion of the
    bordered chain -- r330 build it through zeta's arch, here it
    passes through the SAME chi arch (the border is a construction
    object of the frame); STILL SHARED BY CONSTRUCTION (disclosed,
    not matched because it is not zeta-specific): the prime-power
    anchor grid / window mesh D = 0.5 gap/NU (the support log p^k
    is the SAME for every Dirichlet L over Q), the tent test
    family, the fold map and the depth rule N_w = (S+1)/2 read
    from the world's OWN atom count.

THE TWO WALL INSTRUMENTS (both measured, both in the sealed
adjudication): (E) the document E-Gram wall margin(N_w) = 1 -
lambda_max(E_{N_w}) with the crossing degree minC (smallest n with
lambda_max(E_n) >= 1; lambda_max is monotone in n since E_{n+1} =
E_n + b b^T, so bisection is exact); the PINNING coordinate
minC_ext - (N_w + 1) (MAIN: 0 at w9 -- crossing exactly one past
half-filling); (T) the terminal bordered-chain flip nf
(POSITIVE_PREFIX admission) through the identical r244/r330
channel, adjudicated by the VERBATIM r330 seven-property battery
(DSW.rung_rec / eval_rung / battery_stats / battery_classes with
the identical class rules and the identical live-frozen MAIN
first-5 cubic constant) -- the r330 SPLIT criterion re-adjudicated
with ONLY the frame matched.

THE CONTRACT LEGS:
  LEG A -- the wall census on the sealed ladder (the 42 frame-A
    admissible windows, V.admissible_indices verbatim -- the
    window frame is world-independent by construction, r330
    convention; matched admission floor: >= N_ATOM_MIN kept atoms
    after the chi(n) = 0 drop, exclusions disclosed -- the pool
    carries all 42 for both characters, census printed): per rung
    margin, minC, pinning offset, S/S_+/S_-, terminal nf; the
    r330 battery re-adjudication table (matched class vs the r330
    unmatched record class per property).
  LEG B -- the L* mechanisms on the primary world: the shallow-
    edge pair (PX.pair_select/pair_block verbatim; pair mass, PR),
    the determinant condition c^2 < pq (exact identity + Cauchy
    interlacing wards per rung, r342 a1 backward-error
    normalization), the DICTIONARY UNIVERSALITY TEST (the r342
    weight dictionary with the chi offset: v_pred = -(2/L)
    (1 - cos theta)(F_A^chi - TAIL^chi + f_P^chi) against the
    measured nu weights; density-level ward at the pair folds of
    the sample rungs), and the PHI CO-WANDER (r352/r354: phi_D =
    log(pq) + A_LEAD ln N vs phi_K = log(c^2) + A_LEAD ln N,
    A_LEAD = 17/12, RSA.fine_structure verbatim; usable rows need
    p > 0, q > 0, c^2 > 0 and finite logs -- the r354-a2 clause;
    MAIN through the same instrument as GATE, corr >= 0.99 and
    rmsr <= 0.2; the 500x suppression printed as 1/rmsr).
  LEG C -- the terminal mechanisms: the K2 law FAB grel <= C_2
    with the FROZEN cross-family constant C_2 = 11.87 (the
    r351/r353/r355 pin -- NEVER recalibrated here, that is the
    test) on every live matched row of BOTH characters (FAB =
    m q_max / log m via QGL.fab_of; q_max = mqs.qm on the r314
    fold genealogy; grel = EFA.grel_col, a zone property shared
    with MAIN); the r329 counting constants (nsc_rel/log m <=
    2.0258, ngj/log m <= 2.6351, imported frozen from EFA) --
    the sixth cohort, first arithmetic test; the FAB identity +
    one-sided K2 chain wards (r324/r327) live on every row;
    q_max/FAB scale + dominance (hgn, bshare, maj) census.
  LEG D -- the control discipline OF THE NEW WORLD: the rational
    twin of the chi3 comb (AKD.twin_rational at 1e-8, weights
    untouched) through the matched frame at w9 (margin + pair
    scalars within 1e-3 rel), and the SCRAMBLE analogue (positions
    redrawn uniform on [0, 2 alpha], r-convention seed 1, signed
    chi weights kept, through the SAME matched frame) -- sealed
    break rule: E-wall break at w9 (margin <= 0 or minC <= 0.5
    N_w) or terminal flip ratio <= 0.5.
  LEG E -- must-fails (>= 5, each loud, plus scope audits):
    (m1) ARCH WITHOUT THE CONDUCTOR TERM (the r330 trap exactly):
      only the near-lag constant changes, so the mutant density
      is the true density MINUS log q UNIFORMLY -- caught EXACT
      (max |d_true - d_mut - log q| <= 1e-12 x scale);
    (m2) WRONG PARITY OFFSET a = 0 (conductor kept): the mutant
      arch dictionary misses the w9 chi3 pair folds by >= 0.2 rel
      (measured separation ~2.2 .. 14) while the true chi
      dictionary passes at <= 0.02 -- caught loud;
    (m3) CHI WEIGHTS PERMUTED (world clause): the mod-3 table
      applied at period 4 (DSW.mutant_chi_wrong_period verbatim)
      breaks the periodicity + support wards at the named
      witnesses -- caught exact;
    (m4) DICTIONARY WITH MAIN ARCH instead of chi arch: the
      v_pred mutant misses the measured chi weights by >= 0.5 rel
      (measured ~4.0 .. 4.4) while the chi dictionary passes at
      <= 0.10 -- caught loud;
    (m5) C_2 RECALIBRATED on the chi rows: the mutant consumes
      the withheld fabg_true column (AST-FLAGGED) and on the
      sealed toy returns 3.0 != the sealed toy freeze 1.0 --
      protocol-CAUGHT twice (the frozen constant is the test);
    (m6, scope) MAIN CONTAMINATION: a builder blending untwisted
      MAIN weights (marker MAIN_MM_BLEND) -- AST-FLAGGED.

SEALED VERDICTS (main letter: exactly one fires, total order;
letters/flags appended with '+', combinations allowed):
  TARGET_LEAK  iff any firewall/scope/fragment audit hit;
  FRAME_INSUFFICIENT(named)  iff a derivation ward fails (digamma
    identity, arch/prime/frame reproduction, comb cross-route,
    the chi density dictionary at the frame level) or the primary
    world has < LIVE_MIN live rungs -- the derivation itself
    fails at a named place;
  SECOND_ARITHMETIC_LIVES  iff on the primary world (chi mod 3)
    the E-wall holds (margin > 0 on ALL live rungs) AND the
    verbatim r330 HALF_FILLING class is MAIN-side (nf None on all
    live terminal rungs);
  WALL_ZETA_SPECIFIC  iff both instruments are control-side
    (margin <= 0 on more than half the live rungs AND the r330
    class rule lands CTRL, ratio med <= 0.5);
  WALL_SPLIT_MATCHED(loci)  otherwise (the instruments disagree
    or the wall is partial -- the honest intermediate, census).
  APPENDED: MECHANISMS_TRANSFER(list of TWO_ATOM / DET_COND /
    DICT / PHI that pass their sealed clauses; MECHANISMS_CENSUS
    if none) + [K2_ARITHMETIC_UNIVERSAL iff 0 FABg violations at
    the frozen C_2 AND 0 counting violations on ALL live rows of
    both characters AND >= K2_MIN_ROWS chi3 rows; else
    K2_CENSUS(loci)] + [DICTIONARY_TRANSFERS iff median v_pred
    rel dev <= 0.10 over the chi3 ladder AND the density
    dictionary <= 0.02 at the sample pair folds; else
    DICTIONARY_CENSUS] + [PHI_COWANDER_UNIVERSAL iff corr >=
    0.99 AND rmsr <= 0.2 on >= PHI_MIN_ROWS usable chi3 rows;
    else PHI_CENSUS] + R330_READJUDICATION(property table:
    matched class vs r330 record class; RETYPED_FRAME_ARTIFACT
    per property iff the matched class is MAIN-side where r330
    was control-side) + CHI4_LEDGER(census) + CONTROL_LEDGER
    (twin devs, scramble break) + CONVENTION_LEDGER.

STOP LIST (anti-gates, binding): NO RH claim, NO GRH claim, NO L*
claim, NO bound mechanism, NO certificate, no posthoc bar / class
/ constant move (C_2 = 11.87 frozen), no derived 5/7, mincut
unchanged; a living second arithmetic strengthens the
living-world reading of finitely many measured windows -- it
proves NOTHING about zeta or L(s, chi); a dead wall retypes
finite statistics; GRH only motivates the candidate (under GRH
the zero structure of L(s, chi) is analogous), it is USED
nowhere; r243..r356 stand.

RECORD TABLES: inserted AFTER the record run -- the only
post-freeze docstring edit, which IS the protocol.

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
