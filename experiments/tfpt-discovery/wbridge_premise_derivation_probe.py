"""Exact attack on the two directional premises of the W bridge.

EXPLORATION ONLY.  This probe imports no verification module and writes only
to stdout.  All calculations use exact SymPy arithmetic.

Anti-numerology protocol (declared before calculation)
-------------------------------------------------------
D1 / P-dem:
  Start from the corpus identification
      H^1(P^1 \\ mu4) = chi_1 + chi_2 + chi_3
  and the KMS conditional expectation
      E_4 = (1/4) sum_{r=0}^3 alpha_r.
  Compute the regular four-sector projector, its restriction to the three
  nontrivial character components, and the induced real three-dimensional
  representation.  Test, rather than assume, whether that restriction is
  (1/3) ones ones^T.  Separately compute the S3 augmentation projector so the
  two group averages cannot be conflated.  Type any missing map from deck
  weights to the v4 shift image as a gap.

D2 / P-anch:
  First test the proposed carrier-grading route against the v4/v121 address
  convention and the v410/v135 gradings.  Since a=(1,1,2) does not distinguish
  its first two entries, do not select e1 from the anchor entries alone.
  Instead reconstruct the anchor-address coordinate as the unique solution of
  R x = a, then check the established winding-quadratic/triple-lock response
  for all three coordinate covectors.  A regrading control must move both the
  anchor coordinate and the shift kernel.

Mutants (pre-declared):
  M1. Deck weights (1/2,1/4,1/8,1/8) must break equal nontrivial-sector
      weights and produce nonzero nontrivial Fourier coefficients.
  M2. Swapping generation grades 1 and 2 must move the anchor covector and
      the shift kernel from e1 to e2.
