r"""augmented_borodin_duality_probe -- PRIME.LDAGGER.AUGMENTED_DUALITY.01
(round 362): THE AUGMENTED BORODIN-UVAROV DUALITY -- L† directly as
ONE dual object instead of L* and Terminal separately (the reviewer
moonshot, DCCX typing).  Coexistence: R360 (saturation lane) and R361
(mean-sieve lane) run in parallel -- this probe touches NOTHING
outside its own file and the strictly additive rh-sync.

THE FROZEN QUESTION (reviewer verbatim, binding): in the
mu-orthonormal frame the augmented subordination L† (r332, Lean
sorry-free: L† <=> A_cap > 0 <=> L* AND Terminal) is E† = E + b b^T/B
with E the nu-sampling matrix, b the border functional on the
mu-orthonormal basis and B > 0 the budget; L† <=> I - E† > 0 <=>
lambda_max(E†) < 1.  The border is, by the standing RHP theory
(v958), a rank-1 Schlesinger/Uvarov insertion.  DOES THE EXACT
AUGMENTED DUALITY EXIST: L† <=> R† > (1/2) I with R† a CONTROLLED
rank-1 deformation of the r356 dual hole kernel R -- so that the
critical block of R† carries the L* pair AND the terminal border
fiber in the SAME local object?

THE ROUTE ADJUDICATION (sealed BEFORE the freeze, from the disclosed
s1-s3 scoping):
  ROUTE (i), THE VIRTUAL NODE -- dead on the real windows, twice:
    (a) REPRESENTABILITY: b is a point evaluation b_i = c phat_i(x*)
    iff the recurrence-consistency values x*_i = a_i + (be_i b_{i+1}
    + be_{i-1} b_{i-1})/b_i are constant; measured spread 56.8 (w9)
    .. 4.5e+3 (kz56) -- the real border (the SIGNED smooth-comb
    measure, ~S atoms) is NOT a single virtual atom; (b) SUPPORT:
    every border atom coincides BITWISE with a union grid node (the
    smooth window lives on the SAME folded cosine grid; min distance
    0.0), so the node-polynomial insertion is structurally forbidden
    (the collision ward).  The route survives as the EXACT TOY
    BRIDGE (T3): for a SINGLE-ATOM border the (S+1)-node Uvarov
    complementation holds at the SHIFTED rank N (S† = S + 1 = 2N:
    the half-filling arithmetic moves by exactly one, dual rank
    N - 1 -> N, Fractions-exact) and the literal (S+1)-point dual
    kernel EQUALS the route-(ii) object up to the sign conjugation
    of the new node polynomial (char-poly identical) -- the two
    routes agree where both exist.
  ROUTE (ii), THE BORDERED RESOLVENT (SEALED AS THE CONSTRUCTOR):
    with beta = b/sqrt(B), v = B_m beta the node-side border image
    (v_j = sqrt(nu_j/B) int K_mu(y_j, t) dsigma(t) -- the CD pairing
    of the border measure), gamma = beta^T beta, vt = D v and the
    r356 sign matrix D:
        Z  := [[R^{-1}, vt], [vt^T, 1 + gamma]],   R† := Z^{-1}.
    THE THEOREM PACKAGE (every line an exact finite-matrix fact,
    machine-gated):
      (A1) G† := [[E_n, v], [v^T, gamma]] == D† (Z - I) D† with
           D† = D + [1] -- the r356 complementation EXTENDS: the
           augmented node Gram G† = T† T†^T (T† = the L† observation
           operator) is the D†-conjugate of R†^{-1} - I;
      (A2) THE SPECTRAL MAP: lambda_max(E†) == lambda_max(G†) ==
           1/lambda_min(R†) - 1, i.e. margin† == 2 - 1/lambda_min(R†)
           EXACTLY (the r356 map verbatim on the augmented object);
      (A3) L† <=> R† > (1/2) I (two-sided, gated in both truth
           directions on toys and as sign census live);
      (A4) THE RANK-1 FORM (Sherman-Morrison): R†_{YY} = R +
           (R vt)(R vt)^T/(1 + gamma - vt^T R vt), R†_{bb} = 1/(1 +
           gamma - vt^T R vt) -- the border is a rank-1 insertion at
           the RESOLVENT level of the dual kernel (Z = R^{-1} plus
           one bordered row: the Schlesinger/Uvarov reading of v958,
           now on the DUAL side);
      (A5) L† <=> L* AND Terminal IN DUAL COORDINATES: R† > I/2 <=>
           {R > I/2} AND {q† < 1} with q† := gamma + v^T (I -
           E_n)^{-1} v == u^T H^{-1} u / B (FRAME INVARIANCE of the
           squared dual border norm: the mu-orthonormal route equals
           the mu-tilde chain telescoping S_{N-1} = sum rho_k), and
           the terminal dictionary 1 - q† == (5/7)(1 - q_N)/B_w
           (q_N = rho_{N-1}/(5/7), B_w = S_{N-2} + 5/7, the
           r241/r243/r263 objects verbatim);
      (A6) THE BORDER-SCHUR CLOSED FORM: the Schur complement of
           M† = R† - I/2 onto the border coordinate equals
           (1 - q†)/(2 (1 + q†)) EXACTLY -- the terminal margin IS a
           local Schur datum of the augmented dual object -- and by
           the Schur quotient property the SAME value is carried
           INSIDE the local 3x3 block (pair + border): the border
           fiber is not appended after the fact, it sits in the same
           local object (the moonshot clause, made exact);
      (A7) INTERLACING: lambda_k(R†) <= lambda_k(R) <=
           lambda_{k+1}(R†) (Cauchy on Z = R†^{-1} whose leading
           principal block is R^{-1}) -- the border can only LOWER
           the bottom of the spectrum: margin† <= margin, exactly
           the L† => L* direction, spectrally.
  ROUTE (iii), SCHLESINGER: consumed by (A4) -- the rank-1 insertion
    lives at the dual resolvent; no new RHP machinery is invoked.

THE LEGS: (Leg 0) anchors bit-near: w9 records (S 367, S_- 104, N_w
184, margin 1.6752e-4 rel 0.01, lambda_min(R) 0.500041882 abs 1e-8,
folds (2, 4)); the r359 W9 Schur anchors (eps 4.1882e-5, lamS
4.2003e-5, share 0.6973) reproduced through SWD.schur_rung verbatim;
the r266 terminal records as BORDER-CHAIN gates: D_N == (5/7)(1 -
q_N) at kz15 = 0.0445838321 and kz20 = 0.294659217 (rel 1e-4); the
r352 margin fit slope -3.332 tol 0.02 on the 57.  (Leg A) the exact
augmented algebra (A1)-(A7) gated on the ladder (42 core + 15 + 12
EXT3 + 6 EXT4 = 75 full rows; graded bars; Fractions-exact toys).
(Leg B) the augmented critical block: the 3x3 Schur block S†_3 of
M† at (pair, border): bind† = lambda_min(S†_3)/(lambda_min(R†) -
1/2) in the sealed range (the r359 binding thesis in the augmented
picture), the in-block border Schur == the global border Schur
(quotient, exact), the ev3 band (top local eigenvalue vs the border
Schur value), the border mass of the critical eigenvector (census),
and the pair-only 2x2 contrast (census: the L* channel does not
need the border row; the terminal channel does).  (Leg C) worlds:
the equivalence census {R† > I/2} == {R > I/2} AND {q_N < 1} on all
resolvable rows of MAIN + chi3 + chi4 (the matched r357 frames, 42
rungs each, border = the smooth comb through the SAME chi arch --
the DMF chi_wpack convention; the 5/7 budget corner transported
verbatim, disclosed as convention: the equivalence gates are
budget-agnostic); the rational TWIN (dose-zero BITWISE + pointwise
augmented devs); the matched SCRAMBLE breaks NAMED, two prongs: (p1)
canonical budget -- the border chain leaves the cone (first h-flip
at the sealed degree), (p2) fallback budget B = 1 (the equivalence
is B-agnostic) -- the ALGEBRA (A1/A2/A4/A6) holds world-blind while
the positivity fails at the named R-block clause (lambda_min(R) -
1/2 = -0.4962, the r359 anchor).  (Leg D) the saturation handoff:
R† typed as THE ONE OBJECT for both lanes (bordered dual resolvent),
the interlacing table lambda_k(R†) vs lambda_k(R) printed exactly,
the augmented r359 quantities ((A†^{-1})_kk at the pair, cross
share) as census -- does the rank-1 deformation change the critical
structure?  (Leg E) must-fails (6, each loud): (m1) border WITHOUT
the 1/B normalization -- the mutant q† equals B_w x q† EXACTLY (the
deviation IS the budget factor, 8.38 at w9) and the toy A_cap
equivalence breaks EXACTLY in Fractions; (m2) the WRONG RANK in the
S+1 arithmetic (dual rank N-1 instead of N on the augmented toy) --
the Fractions complementation breaks EXACTLY; (m3) R† FROM
MARGIN-READBACK -- a mutant returning the withheld margin† column
is AST-FLAGGED (scope audit); (m4) SHERMAN-MORRISON WITH THE WRONG
SIGN -- the block identity vs Z^{-1} breaks by >= 1e-3 at w9
(scoped 4.9e-3 = 2x the correction entry) while the honest form
holds at <= 1e-12; (m5) VIRTUAL NODE ON A REAL NODE -- the support
ward (min |t - x_j| == 0 -> REFUSED) fires on the toy collision AND
the census shows every real border atom collides (route (i) is
structurally forbidden); (m6) THE WRONG FRAME -- the mu-tilde chain
coefficients F_k in place of the mu-orthonormal border vector b
break the frame-invariance identity by 0.77 relative at w9 (bar
0.1).

  TARGET_LEAK(loci)  iff any firewall/scope/fragment audit fails /

Honesty before beauty: (A1)-(A7) are exact finite-matrix facts
(theorem-grade SKELETON) whose inputs are measured window scalars
(census-grade FLESH); a verified equivalence is a REPRESENTATION,
not a bound -- L† itself stays exactly as open as L* AND Terminal;
the moonshot gain is STRUCTURAL: one dual object, one critical
block, the border fiber as a bordered resolvent row with an exact
local Schur dictionary; no verdict claims L*, Terminal, a bound
mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any direction; the DCCX
STOP list stands (no capacity products, no local symbol/Fejer
floors, no frame-A growth ceilings, no global g_min bounds, no
worst-case martingale products, no further Borodin coordinate
changes without an analytic theorem, no depth windows only for
exponent fits); r243..r361 stand.

RECORD TABLES: inserted AFTER the record run -- the only
permitted post-freeze edit (two-commit protocol, r329
convention: this sealed spec is committed as "r362
pre-freeze" BEFORE the first full evaluation; the record
insertion discloses the full chronology, every amendment, the
measured verdict and the honest negatives).

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
