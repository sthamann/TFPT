r"""kill_atlas_dag_probe -- PRIME.AUDIT.KILLATLAS.01: the KILL ATLAS and
the typed RH IMPLICATION DAG, as one machine-checked data structure
(2026-08-14, note CCCLXXVI).

EXPLORATION ONLY.  This probe proves nothing about RH.  It supplies no
positivity, no interval, no certificate; it closes no gate, narrows no
gate and moves NO marker.  It is a SYNTHESIS AUDIT: the accumulated
route kills of the campaign (notes CCLXV..CCCLXXV) are encoded as an
explicit atlas, the implication chain from the certified finite head to
RH is encoded as an explicit typed DAG, and the structural claims about
both are re-checked as executable assertions.  NO RH CLAIM.

=====================================================================
WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
=====================================================================
The corpus states the localization in six different coordinate systems
-- tau_h > 0, n_h - q_h > 0, sigma_h <= 1, v_-^T X v_- >= -lam_min(G0),
P_err,h <= Q_h - P_main,h - need_h, and v913's best-conditioned (L) --
and each restatement was recorded in its own note.  Nothing in the tree
holds the whole map in ONE place, in a form a machine can contradict.
Consequence, twice observed by the program's own auditors (CCCXXXVII
C-1, CCCXXXVI): a reader can identify two different objects that carry
the same number, or read a reformulation as an advance.  This file is
the single contradictable object: DAG + atlas as data, with the
typing rules of the audit applied as gates.

THE THREE TYPING RULES APPLIED HERE (frozen, from the audit brief)
  R1  A REFORMULATION IS NOT AN ADVANCE.  Operational test = the
      TAU-SCREEN (registered in PRIME.PORT.BFLOOR.01, bands frozen
      a priori in port_bfloor_uniformity_probe.py): OLS slope s of
      log(candidate margin) against log(tau).  PASS iff |s| <= 0.30,
      RELOCATION iff s >= 0.70.  A candidate that relocates -- or that
      is declared a reparametrization at source -- is DISGUISE.
  R2  THE FROZEN GATE RULE.  Progress on the open edge needs an
      INDEPENDENT SIGN SOURCE that separates true arithmetic from the
      three registered control worlds EPSTEIN (a_Q = r_{x^2+5y^2}/2,
      class number 2, no Euler product), SCRAMBLE (arithmetic-scramble
      = Lambda-label swap; position-scramble = lag relabelling) and
      SMOOTH (the prime-free PNT world).  A certificate that also
      passes on the controls is WALL-BLIND and does not count.
  R3  PROVEN vs MEASURED.  PROVEN = unconditional (or named,
      non-circular premises) in a verification/vN_*.py module or a
      Lean file.  Finitely many certified rungs = CERTIFIED-FINITE.
      Positivity read on finitely many rungs = MEASURED.  Neither is
      PROVEN for all h.

=====================================================================
THE DAG, AS TYPED HERE (10 edges, 11 nodes; see DAG_EDGES)
=====================================================================
  E1  SRC        -> BPOS       CERTIFIED-FINITE  v905 (min c_B .5523)
  E2  SRC        -> SPOS       CERTIFIED-FINITE  v897/v907 + sigma-chain
                                                 (CONDITIONAL: tau(r1))
  E3  BPOS,SPOS  -> MPOS_FIN   PROVEN            v901 Schur equivalence
  E5  SRC        -> HCONV      PROVEN            v912 FORMCONV-PROVEN
  E4  MPOS_FIN   -> HCOF       OPEN              --
  E6  HCOF,HCONV -> QW_DENSE   PROVEN            CofinalWeil.lean/v848
  E7  QW_DENSE   -> QW_CLASS   CITED-CLASSICAL   density + Dini leg
  E8  SRC        -> W1ID       CITED-CLASSICAL   v630/v643 identification
  E9  QW_CLASS,W1ID -> WEILPOS CITED-CLASSICAL   capped == Weil
  E10 WEILPOS    -> RH         CITED-CLASSICAL   Weil's criterion

THE FIRST OPEN EDGE IS E4, and E4 ONLY -- but E4 is NOT the only edge
that fails to be PROVEN.  The honest non-PROVEN list in topological
order is [E1, E2, E8, E4, E7, E9, E10].  E1/E2 are finite by
construction (nothing is missing in them; their SCOPE is finite), and
E7..E10 are classical citations.  The corpus headline "the chain is
reduced to exactly one unproven inequality" (CCCLXXIV) is therefore
right about INEQUALITIES and about what the program must supply, and
the module docstrings say the rest correctly (v912: "Edge 6 of the
implication DAG is NARROWED, not closed"; v848: STEP 3/STEP 4
classical cited) -- the headline is where the four citations vanish.
Gate D4 pins exactly this list so the count cannot drift.

=====================================================================
THE CIRCULARITY LEDGER (gate D5; each entry must be flagged as data)
=====================================================================
  X1  E2 CONSUMES ITS OWN CONCLUSION THROUGH A SELECTION GATE.  The
      sigma-chain step matrices are tau(r1)-normalized, so each
      per-cell certificate proves tau(r1)*S(r2) > 0, not S(r2) > 0;
      tau(r1) > 0 is an uncertified float64 selection gate of the
      PREVIOUS rung (chain_adversary_probe, CCCXXXIII: refusal branch
      fires on 0/85 built cells; on 83/85 the r2 positivity is already
      an admission premise).  Typed CONDITIONAL, not circular-fatal.
  X2  EVERY MAX-TAU-PER-BIN SUB-LADDER IS SIGN-MINED.  It selects
      rungs by tau, a wall OUTPUT, so it can never instantiate E4's
      predefined idx (CCCXXXVII Q-3).  The compliant rule exists and
      is frozen pre-build: MAX-GAP-PER-BIN (census geometry only).
  X3  KAPPA = 1 IS DEFINITIONAL.  The coupling Gram and the coisometry
      Gram are entrywise equal (2.2e-15) and kappa = 1 survives purely
      random densities on 3/3 worlds -- two code paths, zero arithmetic
      content (CCCXXXIII).  Any "coupling scalar" advance built on it
      is a relabelling.
  X4  THE KREIN CONTRACTOR MUST BE SOURCE-SIDE.  KreinDefect.lean types
      the circularity warning in its own module doc: a target-computed
      C (eigendata, or the converse's pseudoinverse) is a reformulation
      of the positivity, and feeding it back is circular.
  X5  W2 CONSUMES ZERO DATA AS A CITATION.  v909's W2 face reads
      2e7 certified ordinates; that is legitimate for a FINITE
      certificate and can never prove RH (ledger says so verbatim).
      It is zero data inside E2's scope, never inside E4.
  CLEAN: v901's n, q are source-only (no tau_{h+1}, no forward sign --
      the gap sign is output, never input); v913 predicts h from its
      own prime-power sieve rather than consuming it; v912 bans every
      zero/primality oracle by AST; v848 never evaluates (H).

=====================================================================
WHAT THE GATES PIN, AND WHAT THEY DO NOT
=====================================================================
PINNED: the DAG shape (acyclicity, reachability, the topological
position of the single OPEN edge, the non-PROVEN list); artifact
existence on disk for every PROVEN/CERTIFIED-FINITE edge; ledger
membership of every cited vN module; atlas well-formedness (one edge
per killed route, declared verdict enum vocabulary, declared
tau-screen and control-screen vocabulary); the presence of each atlas
verdict enum in the named artifact on disk; and eleven load-bearing
numbers re-derived or re-grepped here (N1..N11).

Gate A2.2 -- "every atlas verdict enum literally occurs in its own
cited artifact" -- is the sharpest gate in this file, and it bit on the
first run: it rejected twelve rows whose verdict token this audit had
PARAPHRASED rather than copied (ABEL-TOO-WEAK for the real
TAILABEL-MEASURED, KSTAR-UNBOUNDED for GRAMRADAU-MEASURED,
FLOOR-VS-INVERSE-DEAD for PGSCHUR-MEASURED, and nine more).  The tokens
below are therefore grep-earned, not authored.  Where a campaign
verdict was recorded only in the note and never frozen as a probe enum
(EXTERIOR-HALFGAP-REFUSED), the cited artifact is experiments/next.txt,
the primary historical record.

NOT PINNED (a false input here would NOT fail this probe): every
MEASURED number of the campaign; the correctness of any cited
classical theorem; whether the atlas is COMPLETE (it is complete over
the routes named in notes CCLXV..CCCLXXV that touch the chain, which
is an editorial claim, not a gate); and the truth value of E4.

TWO CORRECTIONS THIS FILE CARRIES (both against the brief it audits)
  A1  NOGO-COMPOSITE-VERIFIED IS NOT AN ADVANCE.  It is the verdict of
      signed_only_nogo_probe.py (87/87); the PROMOTED module v913 emits
      NOGO-CORE-VERIFIED (24/24).  Both are typed no_go_typing [O] and
      the ledger row is titled, verbatim, "A NO-GO / TYPING ROW AND
      EXPLICITLY NOT PROGRESS", adding that it "must NOT be counted as
      evidence for or against the Riemann Hypothesis".  Listing it
      among the advances inverts its own type.
  A2  WIRING-DEGENERATE AND THETA-CONVENTIONAL ARE OFF-CHAIN.  Both
      are seam/compiler-lane results (SEAM.STATE.WIRING.SELECTOR.01,
      promoted in v911): the wiring freedom theorem and the theta_S
      collar frame.  They attack no edge of this DAG.  Gate D6 pins
      them as the ONLY off-chain rows.

SCOPE: this file plus the CCCLXXVI note in experiments/next.txt are the
only writes.  No verification/, no papers, no ledger, no website, no
manifests, no Lean, no .md, no commit.  Stdlib only.  NO RH CLAIM.
