PRIME.L2.FOLD_DENSITY_DICTIONARY.01 (round 339): THE DENSITY
MARTINGALE AND THE MOMENT DICTIONARY -- the reviewer's
reformulation of the terminal target.

CONTEXT (binding, from the sealed records r324/r327/r333/r335/
r337): the terminal has so far been routed through a MAXIMUM --
q_max x M_2 replaces a third moment by an L-infinity bound, and
exactly this loss shows in the mid-band (kz73/76/61 + deep
kz95/98/109), where the r335 dichotomy loses a factor 6-10
although no single atom is large enough.  The reviewer
adjudication (verbatim, binding): the new currency is a REVERSE
HOLDER PROBLEM for a canonical martingale weight process on the
fold genealogy.  IMPORTANT verdict-reading rule (reviewer
verbatim): r337 tested the RAW SIGNED fold-mass process inside
the argmax block -- its letter (MARTINGALE_STRUCTURE_ONLY, and a
NOT_A_MARTINGALE would have been equally honest) is IRRELEVANT
here; the density per remaining descendant is a martingale BY
ALGEBRA.  This round is INDEPENDENT of r337.

THE PROCESS (reviewer verbatim): let the canonical fold genealogy
be a tree/forest over the m final atoms a_i = |PDelta_i| (the
level-2 block values).  For every node v: A(v) = sum_{i under v}
a_i, n(v) = #{i under v}, density d(v) = A(v)/n(v).  Draw a final
atom uniformly from the m leaves, V_k = its ancestor at level k
(root = level 0).  Normalized: X_k = d(V_k)/d(root).
THE THEOREM (exact algebra only, no fit):
  E[X_{k+1} | V_k = v]
    = X_k x sum_c (n(c)/n(v)) (A(c)/n(c)) / (A(v)/n(v))
    = X_k x sum_c A(c)/A(v) = X_k
-- X_k is a nonnegative martingale from MASS CONSERVATION alone.
THE MOMENT DICTIONARY (exact): at leaf i, X_inf = a_i/(A/m) =
m q_i, hence E[X_inf^2] = m M_2 and E[X_inf^3] = m^2 M_3.  The
terminal target M_3 <= C (log m)^A / m^2 is EQUIVALENT to
E[X_inf^3] <= C (log m)^A.  The exponent 2 is no fit -- at
uniform mass M_3 = 1/m^2 exactly (the cubic scaling of the
uniform tree).
THE LOCAL ANATOMY: for child c of v: p_c = n(c)/n(v), R_c =
d(c)/d(v); exactly sum_c p_c R_c = 1.  Local cubic inflation
Gamma(v) = sum_c p_c R_c^3, with E[X_{k+1}^3 | V_k = v] =
X_k^3 Gamma(v); at equidistribution Gamma = 1.  The whole
deviation from the optimal law is the accumulated local density
inflation.
THE DRIFT CLAUSE (reviewer clause 5): if a predictable drift
appears on the chosen genealogy, test whether it is a period-4
component expressible as a bounded coboundary A_k = G_{k+4} -
G_k -- then subtract the predictable part exactly and only the
centered rest enters the moment inequality.  (X_k itself has
ZERO drift by algebra; the drift clause is applied to the
predictable LOG drift delta_k = E[ln X_{k+1}] - E[ln X_k] <= 0,
Jensen-exact, warded live.)

LEG 0 -- THE CANONICAL GENEALOGY (adjudicated BEFORE the freeze,
sealed by this SPEC_SHA; the e4 mutant proves the protocol audit
bites).  Named canonical tree choices over the m final atoms:
  (a) THE ITERATED r270 FOLD (CHOSEN): bottom-up pairing of
      adjacent blocks in position order (PAIR_OFFSET 0, odd tail
      its own single-child node), iterated to the root.  Three
      reasons, frozen a-priori: (i) PARAMETER-FREE -- the r270
      level-2 convention verbatim, no new tunable; (ii)
      CONSTRUCTION-CANONICAL -- the final atoms PDelta_j were
      themselves created by exactly this adjacent-pair fold on
      the signed runs, so iterating it upward IS the fold
      ancestry ("which atom from which fold"); (iii)
      POSITION-CONTIGUOUS -- every node is a contiguous position
      interval, compatible with the r333/r335 support/margin
      geometry (the Leg-D bridge can talk to the r335 mass arm).
  (b) BALANCED TOP-DOWN BISECTION (ceil | floor): differs from
      (a) only in the placement of odd counts -- kept as the
      SENSITIVITY column (the exact identities are TREE-FREE by
      algebra and are warded on both trees; the Gamma budget is
      compared census-grade).
  (c) a genealogy descending INTO the blocks (leaves = fold
      groups or runs): REFUSED a-priori -- the contract fixes
      the leaves at the m final atoms a_i = |PDelta_i| (the
      dictionary X_inf = m q_i is the round's currency).
  GROUNDING (r327 mass mechanics): the leaf masses are the exact
  fold recomposition -- the r327 group partition (sum_g gabs ==
  A1_j), the L1 recomposition and the two-ancestor bound are
  re-warded live (GMC ledger cross-ward, verbatim).
  THE HEAVY-JUMP THRESHOLD (a-priori): a node is HEAVY iff
  max_c R_c > R_STAR = 3/2 -- for a balanced pair this is
  exactly "the light child falls below the band floor 1/4 of
  the pair mass", the SAME 1/4 as the r333/r335 band theorem;
  sensitivity column R_ALT = 7/4 (light share < 1/8).

LEG A -- fold_mass_tree_exact + descendant_density_martingale:
the tree built exactly; the martingale identity E[X_{k+1}|V_k]
= X_k verified EXACTLY (bit-equal Fractions: per node
sum_c A(c) == A(v) as exact rationals on the small windows w9 +
w13) and f64-warded on the full ladder + EXT3 + controls (per
node |sum_c p_c R_c - 1|, per level |E[X_k] - 1|, the exact
cubic recursion E[X_{k+1}^3] == sum_v P(v) X_v^3 Gamma(v), the
envelope E[X_inf^3] <= prod_k max_v Gamma).  This is an
IDENTITY, not a test -- must-fail e1: the wrong child weighting
(p_c without n) breaks it exactly on the uneven toy.

LEG B -- martingale_moment_dictionary: E[X_inf^2] == m M_2 and
E[X_inf^3] == m^2 M_3 exact (Fractions on the toys, f64 <=
DICT_BAR live); anchored bit-near against the r324 chain per
rung (m M_2 == the r324-pre m2 state, max y/m == the q_max
state, E[X_inf^3] == rho_2 (log m)^2 -- the r306 NORM identity).
DISCLOSED KNOWN PRE-SPEC: via the dictionary the banked r306
record C_2 = 1.069 with 0/57 violations ALREADY reads
E[X_inf^3] <= 1.069 (log m)^2 pointwise on the 57-rung set --
the genuinely open content of this round is the GAMMA BUDGET
(the pathwise Reverse-Holder question: is the worst-case
per-level product summable?), the anatomy (WHERE the inflation
sits), the good/heavy split and the drift.

LEG C -- THE GAMMA ANATOMY (the core measurement), on MAIN/
twin/EPSTEIN/SCRAMBLE over the WHOLE ladder + the 12 EXT3
anchors (r329 record, r335 adoption verbatim, PURE TEST rows),
resolved by level k: per level Gamma_max(k); the budget
W_F = prod_k Gamma_max(k) (E[X_inf^3] <= W_F exact); the good
budget W_G = prod_k max over GOOD nodes (heavy nodes excluded,
factor 1 if a level has no good node -- sealed definition); the
heavy leaf share hsh (fraction of leaves below >= 1 heavy node,
exact union); the per-level argmax anatomy (level k*, node
position third) for the named spike family kz53/83/67/55 and
the mid-band family kz73/76/61 + kz95/98/109.  Kernfragen:
(i) is log Gamma summable -- W_F <= C_F(a) (log m)^a, a in
GA_FAM = (1, 2, 3), mid-ladder max-cal freeze (TRB verbatim),
test incl. EXT3, named 4/4?  (ii) WHERE does the inflation sit
(levels, spikes vs mid-band)?  (iii) does the Gamma anatomy
separate the worlds (SCRAMBLE may break the local structure --
census, no adjudication)?  (iv) drift measurement + the
period-4 coboundary test (pooled ladder-median level profile;
direct ratio r4 = sum |delta_{k+4} - delta_k| / sum |delta_k -
mean| and the exact phase-mean subtraction ratio r4c; coboundary
letter iff r4c <= R4_BAR = 1/2, a-priori; DISCLOSED: with only
K = 7..10 levels per rung the per-rung period-4 test is weak --
the pooled profile is the honest form, census-grade).

LEG D -- THE BRIDGE (measurement only, NO claim): how much
polylog budget would the GOOD tree need if the r335 mass arm
stops the heavy jumps (max_c R_c > R_STAR)?  The per-rung
two-arm decomposition is printed (hsh = heavy leaf share,
n_heavy, W_G = accumulated good inflation, W_F) -- the
PREPARATION for R341 (Bellman / Reverse Holder), NOT its
execution.  The good budget certification W_G <= C_G(a)
(log m)^a is gated alongside.

LEG E -- WARDS / MUST-FAILS (>= 4 mutants + 2 scope mutants):
(e1) WRONG CHILD WEIGHTING: mutant_child_weight uses p_c =
  1/#children instead of n(c)/n(v) -- on the uneven Fractions
  toy (3, 1, 1) the conditional returns 9/10 != 1 (break 1/10
  EXACT) -- CAUGHT exact; the live census counts the uneven
  nodes the mutant would corrupt.
(e2) MOMENT DICTIONARY WITH m INSTEAD OF m^2:
  mutant_dict_m_power claims E[X_inf^3] == m M_3 -- on the
  Fractions toy the break is 20/9 - 5/9 = 5/3 EXACT -- CAUGHT
  exact.
(e3) GAMMA READ BACK FROM THE TARGET: mutant_gamma_from_target
  derives a 'Gamma column' from the cubic record (consumes
  cm/S3) -- the PHI3_FORBIDDEN scan must FLAG it (AST-CAUGHT)
  while the module-own tree builders stay clean.
(e4) TREE CHOICE AFTER RECORD SIGHT (protocol):
  mutant_tree_posthoc re-picks the pairing offset after sight of
  the evaluated bound column (consumes rho) -- the
  BOUND_FORBIDDEN scope audit must FLAG it AND on the sealed toy
  it returns offset 1 != the canonical PAIR_OFFSET 0 --
  protocol-CAUGHT twice (the genealogy is sealed in Leg 0 BEFORE
  the freeze).
(m5a/m5b) WORLD-BLINDNESS BREAK: a builder consuming the
  withheld terminal drive key and a builder consuming the branch
  label are both FLAGGED by the AST scope audit.

SEALED VERDICTS (exactly one fires; total order):
   TARGET_LEAK                 iff any purity/scope/literal audit
       hit on the tree builders,
   MASS_TREE_NOT_CANONICAL     iff a structural ward breaks on a
       live world (martingale identity / unit mean / cubic
       recursion / dictionary / Jensen sign / the r327
       partition-recomposition grounding / the Fractions
       bit-equality on w9+w13 / the tree-free identities under
       the alternative tree),
   DENSITY_MARTINGALE_EXACT    iff all exact wards hold AND the
       FULL Gamma budget certifies at minimal a in GA_FAM
       (W_F <= C_F(a) (log m)^a, 0 test violations incl. EXT3 +
       named 4/4) -- summable inflation: the R341
       recommendation (Bellman) is printed with concrete
       constants,
   GOODTREE_A2_ONLY            iff not the full budget but the
       GOOD-TREE budget certifies at some a (the two-arm
       decomposition carries; the minimal good a is printed
       inside),
   LOCAL_INFLATION_SUPERCRITICAL  otherwise -- log Gamma is not
       summable in this language either; said honestly, with
       the measured exponents printed inside.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO
promotion, NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO RH CLAIM in
either direction.  Coexistence: r337 (raw signed fold process)
is sealed and INDEPENDENT (see the verdict-reading rule above);
r338 (reading audit) may run in parallel; this probe touches
NOTHING outside its own file and the strictly additive rh-sync
(existing entries byte-identical).  Two-commit freeze protocol
(r329 convention): spec committed pre-freeze, record tables the
only post-freeze edit, committed again.
