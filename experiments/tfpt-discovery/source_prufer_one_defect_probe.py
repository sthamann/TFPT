PRIME.TERMINAL.SOURCE_PRUFER_ONE_DEFECT.01 (round 372): THE
SOURCE-JACOBI PHASE THEOREM -- V2 and T1 jointly, the spike
extracted not averaged (reviewer solution 2 / Terminal).

CONTEXT (binding, from DCCXXIX after r363-r368).  Terminal is no
longer treated independently of L*.  Under CanonicalWindow and L*
(as a hypothesis -- certified on the measured windows) the finite
Jacobi chain belonging to v2 is positive, the recurrence
coefficients are positive, the Pruefer phase is well-defined.
THE SOURCE-JACOBI PHASE THEOREM (candidate): the Pruefer phase of
the polynomial v2 on the x-mask has (1) a monotone bulk phase,
(2) controlled discrete curvature, (3) at most ONE canonical
turning block, (4) an explicit local estimate in that block.
FROM THE SAME THEOREM must follow: V2 (run-length regularity --
run lengths ARE phase dwell times) AND F_i <= C (log m)^A for
every normal block (the T1 theorem on the non-defect part).  For
the turning block the dominant group is treated SEPARATELY:
  (10) q*^3 <= C* (log m)^A / m^2
  (11) sum_{i != *} q_i^3 <= C_rest (log m)^A / m^2
  ==> M3 <= C (log m)^A / m^2 ==> N3 >= m/polylog ==> N2 >= N3
  ==> Fejer/vdC ==> q_N < 1.
THE r368 LESSON: kz117 carries 90.9 pct of its own pi-measure --
averaging fails; the right operation is SPIKE EXPLICITLY
EXTRACTED, REST UNIVERSALLY CONTROLLED.  Verdicts (verbatim):
ONE_DEFECT_TERMINAL_GO / SPIKE_NOT_UNIQUE / REST_T1_STILL_GROWS /
PHASE_RESTATEMENT.

Hard requirements: (1) the Pruefer-to-run dictionary EXACT;
(2) V2 from phase regularity; (3) the universal T1 bound after
removal of ONE canonically defined heavy group; (4) THE SAME
rule must carry kz111, kz117 AND kz124; (5) direct composition
to q_N < 1.

THE LEGS:
  LEG 0 -- ANCHORS bit-near: r365 (v2 reconstruction, XOR sign
    identity, x-mask, the minimal V2 violator (...,r,r,1,1,1));
    r368 (F/E_pi columns, the spike anatomy); r361/r358
    (gap/floor, F_i).
  LEG A -- THE PRUEFER-TO-RUN DICTIONARY (the exact core):
    discrete Pruefer phase theta_k of the v2-chain (standard:
    via the recurrence / sign changes; well-defined under L*
    positivity) and the dictionary: sign-block run lengths ==
    dwell times of the phase in half-periods (exact, Fractions
    on the toy, f64 live on all 134+ windows).  V2 becomes a
    PHASE statement: the violator (...,r,r,1,1,1) == a specific
    phase pattern (long dwell + three fast flips).
  LEG B -- PHASE ANATOMY: bulk monotonicity, discrete curvature,
    COUNT turning blocks (sealed: slope-outlier clusters, merge
    gap MERGE_GAP; dwell outliers as the vacuous-slope fallback)
    on all windows of all four worlds.  Is the turning block
    UNIQUE (the one-defect thesis -- if > 1: SPIKE_NOT_UNIQUE
    honestly)?  Does it coincide with the dominant beta/omega
    group and the F-spikes (kz111/117/124 -- core test 4)?
  LEG C -- THE TWO-PART BOUND: (i) the universal F-bound on the
    NON-defect blocks (sealed (C, A) bars, all worlds -- 0
    violations?); (ii) the separate q* bound for the defect
    block (measure q*^3 m^2 / (log m)^A); (iii) V2 from phase
    regularity (violator exclusion as a phase census).
  LEG D -- THE COMPOSITION: (10)+(11) ==> M3-polylog ==> the
    full chain to q_N < 1 (polylog convention, no premature
    powering); the new m0* against 10^16.1/10^10.0; the cofinal
    typing (what is SATZ modulo L*, what is census).
  LEG E -- WORLDS + MUST-FAILS (>= 5): matched SCRAMBLE (breaks
    where -- the phase should be chaotic there: measure the
    turning count), Twin, chi.  Must-fails: phase from the runs
    circularly instead of from the recursion -> AST/construction
    CAUGHT; turning definition after sight -> protocol-CAUGHT;
    defect group chosen posthoc -> CAUGHT (canonical definition
    before the freeze); F-bars after sight -> CAUGHT; wrong
    half-period convention -> exact CAUGHT.

SEALED VERDICTS (main letter: TARGET_LEAK / LAW_STATE_NOT_EXACT
take precedence; otherwise the four reviewer letters):
  TARGET_LEAK  iff any firewall/scope/fragment/literal audit
    hit on the module-own builders;
  LAW_STATE_NOT_EXACT  iff an exact ward breaks (dictionary,
    Fractions toys, XOR identity, N2 >= N3, two-part sum);
  ONE_DEFECT_TERMINAL_GO  iff the dictionary is exact on every
    live row AND turning uniqueness holds on every MAIN row AND
    the named spikes kz111/117/124 coincide with the canonical
    defect AND the rest-T1 a-priori bars have 0 violations AND
    the q* and rest-M3 bars hold AND V2 holds with the
    phase-pattern exclusion AND the composed m0* is at most the
    r361 census 10^16.1;
  SPIKE_NOT_UNIQUE  iff uniqueness fails on any MAIN row (or on
    a named spike row);
  REST_T1_STILL_GROWS  iff uniqueness holds but the rest-T1
    a-priori bars still violate (the extraction did not tame F);
  PHASE_RESTATEMENT  iff the dictionary holds but phase
    regularity does not exclude the V2 violator (n_turn > 1 is
    common on V2-regular windows, or interior chain progress is
    absent -- we renamed runs to dwells).
  Combinations with CENSUS flags are allowed when GO does not
    fire and none of the three negative letters is forced.

smoke = toys + trees + mutants + scope/purity audits + the four
w9 worlds with chain Pruefer, dictionary, positivity, V2;
ladders, anchors, deep censuses, composition, scrambles, twin
and adjudication skipped.

DISCLOSED PRE-SPEC INPUT (no scratch run of THIS probe's sealed
adjudication): every anchor band is an r353..r368 RECORD number
adopted as-is; the dictionary is DERIVED a priori from the
sin-representation v_n = rho sin(theta_n) of the Jacobi
recurrence (Killip-Simon / Teschl discrete Pruefer: atan2 of
consecutive chain values, unwrapped in the degree direction,
then along x).  Run length of sign(v2) equals occupancy of
floor(theta/pi) on the x-mask IF the half-period convention is
pi AND consecutive x-nodes do not skip a k*pi crossing of a
different parity than the sign -- the Fractions toy is
hand-computed: theta_k = (k + 1/2)*(pi/2) for k = 0..7 gives
floor(theta/pi) runs (2,2,2,2) = sign(sin theta) runs EXACT;
wrong half 2*pi gives (4,4) != (2,2,2,2) CAUGHT exact.  The
minimal V2 violator x-runs (3^8, 1,1,1) fails V2; the spike
(2^8, 3,3, 1,1,1) holds.  Two-part toy q = (1/2, 1/4, 1/4),
m = 4, lg = 2, A = 2: q*^3 = 1/8, rest = 1/32, M3 = 5/32,
q*-score = 1/2, rest-score = 1/8.  Interior chain progress on a
run of length >= 3 is STRICTLY positive for the recurrence
phase and ZERO for the circular (run-counting) phase -- that
is the construction catch.  ONE SCOPING PASS (machinery
validation at w9 only): the four w9 worlds exist through the
r358 channel; every deep turning count, coincidence, rest-T1
census, q* score and composed m0* are GENUINELY OPEN.  Timing:
r368 full pass 708.8 s (adopted as the deep budget estimate).
C_F, A_F, C_STAR, C_REST, SLOPE_RATIO, SLOPE_MIN, MERGE_GAP,
DWELL_RATIO, DWELL_MIN, MONO_FRAC and all anchor tolerances are
fixed BEFORE any deep evaluation; the letters are symmetric
and total by CONTRACT.  Canonical defect (frozen): if the
slope-outlier cluster count n_turn == 1, that unique cluster
IS the turning block; elif n_turn == 0 and the dwell-outlier
count n_dwell == 1, that unique long run IS the turning block;
elif both are 0, the defect is VACUOUS (rest = all); else
SPIKE_NOT_UNIQUE.  The mass-group i* is the theta-order block
of largest |q| whose centre lies in the turning x-interval
(nearest centre if no overlap) -- NEVER argmax q in isolation.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-28).  experiments/ level: NO
promotion, NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO RH CLAIM in
either direction.  Coexistence: R369 / R371 / R373 run in
parallel -- own files only; git pull before the strictly
additive rh-sync.  Two-commit freeze protocol (r329
convention): spec committed pre-freeze, record tables the
only post-freeze edit, committed again.

Honesty before beauty: the dictionary, the Fractions toys, the
XOR identity, N2 >= N3, the two-part sum and the purity audits
are EXACT (Fractions/AST-decided); turning uniqueness, spike
coincidence, rest-T1, q*, V2-from-phase and every composed m0*
are MEASURED on the finite 89 + 8 + 42 + 42 row surface only --
a 0-violation census fixes a CENSUS THEOREM, not a cofinal
law; ONE_DEFECT_TERMINAL_GO here means the one-defect
extraction replaces averaging ON THIS SURFACE at the sealed
a-priori grade; g_i is a construction-local coordinate, said
out loud; L* is a hypothesis (certified on measured MAIN
windows); r243..r368 stand.
