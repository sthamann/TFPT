r"""delta_source_anatomy_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.DELTA_SOURCE_ANATOMY.01
(round 348): THE DELTA SOURCE ANATOMY -- the order-0 mirror as an
object, and the resolvent rate-equality theorem candidate
delta_p == delta_q == delta.  The named successor round of r347
(ALPHA_CLOSED): the ONE remaining measured exponent of the L*
margin law, delta = 2.668 (the cancellation law c'/c ~ N_w^-2.67,
r345), is put under source anatomy -- can it be derived from the
digamma/tent geometry of the mirror paths, or at least reduced to
a theorem-grade structure statement (a common dressing rate) plus
an elementary remainder?

THE CHAIN (r342/r343/r345/r347, all sealed records): r342 the
two-atom law (bare decay laws p -0.754 / q -0.645 / c -0.697;
digamma/tent weight dictionary at v_pred 9.0e-4); r343 the exact
resolvent dressing (Delta c = sum_m alpha_m beta_m/(1 - delta_m)
over the rest modes; the dressing works by the signed cancellation
Delta c ~ -c); r345 the mirror anatomy (rho_0 median 0.839: the
DIRECT path u1.u2 carries the bulk of the mirror in PATHS, yet
M90 ~ 30 modes: multi-modal in MODES) and THE CANCELLATION LAW
delta = 2.668 (halves-stable, EXT3 10/12 high-side, EXT4 6/6);
r347 the one-line closure alpha = a_c + delta (residual 0.033, all
four closures <= 0.1) plus the UNIVERSALITY CENSUS |delta_p -
delta| = 0.059, |delta_q - delta| = 0.003 -- the dressing eats p,
q and c near a COMMON rate, census-grade, honestly no law.  THE
ROUND'S CONTRACT: (Leg A) the order-0 mirror anatomy -- the exact
split of the resolvent series at order zero,
    Delta c = u1.u2 + sum_m alpha_m beta_m delta_m/(1 - delta_m)
(direct overlap + resolvent enhancement; derived from (I-D)^{-1} =
I + D (I-D)^{-1} projected onto the rest eigenmodes, verified in
exact Fractions on the hand toy and per rung in f64 on all 75
rows), the mode census of the carriers (peel pairs? arch layer?),
the dictionary reach of the overlap products (weight side vs
kernel side), and the sealed delta_0 fit of the ORDER-0 MISS
y0 = 1 - rho_0; (Leg B) THE RATE-EQUALITY THEOREM CANDIDATE made
exact: with (lambda_1, lambda_2) the top-2 eigenvalues of E and
(a_k, b_k) the pair components of their eigenvectors, the top-2
truncation of the resolvent pair block M gives EXACTLY
    p'_2 = m (g21 a2^2 + b2^2)/Dt^2,
    q'_2 = m (g21 a1^2 + b1^2)/Dt^2,
    c'_2 = m (g21 a1 a2 + b1 b2)/Dt^2,
      Dt = a1 b2 - a2 b1,  m = margin,  g21 = (1-l2)/(1-l1)
(exact 2x2 algebra of M_2^{-1} = I - A'_2; exact in Fractions on a
rank-2 rational model and through the FULL Schur chain on a
block-spectral 4x4) -- UNDER TOP-2 DOMINANCE WITH FLAT GEOMETRY
every dressed scalar is margin x an O(1) geometry factor, hence
    delta_x = alpha - a_x   for x in {p, q, c}:
THE COMMON DRESSING RATE IS THE MARGIN RATE, and the naive
statement delta_p == delta_q == delta is exactly true IFF the bare
rates coincide (a_p == a_q == a_c) -- otherwise it breaks by
exactly the bare-rate spread (proved on synthetic families with
controlled structure, and the flat-geometry hypothesis is
load-bearing: an angle drift breaks the equality loudly); (Leg C)
the delta decomposition delta == alpha - a_c with every building
block typed (theorem-grade skeleton / certified census /
fit-census) and the irreducible measured rest named; (Leg D) the
mirror-quota anatomy on MAIN/TWIN, the sealed world clause
re-gated (8 worlds incl. the r330 Dirichlet pair), and the
concentration-weak rungs kz28/kz44/kz59 as their own row family;
(Leg E) must-fails.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO promotion,
NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO L* CLAIM, NO RH CLAIM in either
direction, mincut unchanged.  Coexistence: R346 (cover
canonization, terminal lane) is sealed and synced -- this probe
touches NOTHING outside its own file and the strictly additive
rh-sync.  Two-commit freeze protocol (r329 convention): spec +
machinery committed BEFORE the record run, record tables inserted
after.

THE EXACT OBJECTS (all gated): per rung the r342 bundle
(PX.build_rung verbatim, SPEC_SHA prefix gated b09f8ccd), the r343
extension (PC3.extend_rung verbatim, 9ffc2705: rest eigenmodes,
Delta c, top-K shadows, K_res), the r347 closure coordinates
(DA.closure_cols verbatim, bd1aa7f3: p', q', c', bridge, c'/c,
p'/p, q'/q, the one-line identity wards); THE ORDER-0 SPLIT (this
round's first exact spine): from (I-D)^{-1} = I + D (I-D)^{-1},
Delta c = u1^T (I-D)^{-1} u2 splits EXACTLY as T0 + T+ with T0 =
u1.u2 (the order-0 direct path) and T+ = sum_m alpha_m beta_m
delta_m/(1 - delta_m) (all higher paths, mode-resolved); the
mirror quotas rho_0 = -T0/c, rho_hi = -T+/c, the ORDER-0 MISS
y0 = 1 - rho_0, and the exact bookkeeping identity c'/c = y0 -
rho_hi (gated per rung); THE TWO-LEVEL DRESSED-SCALAR SHADOWS
(this round's second exact spine): p'_2, q'_2, c'_2 as above --
exact for the top-2-truncated resolvent (Fractions), measured
against the true dressed scalars per rung (the truncation census);
THE MARGIN-PINNING RATIOS p'/margin, q'/margin, |c'|/margin --
the live signature of the rate-equality candidate, adjudicated
under the r345 curvature-honest flatness protocol verbatim
(GR.curvflat_protocol, 1f99235a); THE MODE CENSUS: per rung the
L1 profile of the mode terms alpha_m beta_m/(1 - delta_m) (top-1
share, M90 at the sealed 0.9 quantile), the arch-rim share of T0
in ATOM terms, the arch-rim mass and peel-pair mass of the top
carrying MODE; THE DICTIONARY REACH (weight side): T0 = sqrt(v1
v2) sum_j v_j K(y1, y_j) K(y2, y_j) -- the weight factors v_j are
replaced by the r342 digamma/tent prediction v_pred(theta_j)
(PX.v_predict verbatim) with the kernel rows measured: the sealed
sample census DICT_T0 (the weight side of the overlap products is
dictionary-explicit iff the median deviation over the six sample
rungs is <= 0.10; the kernel side stays census-grade -- r342
negative #4, never upgraded).

INDEX FIREWALL (binding, r238-r347 discipline): w = window (kz

Gram / spectrum / weight / position arrays and measured columns

DELTA_REC and the verdict-side columns); no zero/prime oracles

LEG 0 -- ANCHORS BIT-NEAR (r342/r343/r345/r347 record numbers as
gates): w9 records (S 367, N_w 184, lambda 0.99983248, margin
1.6752e-4); the r347 w9 closure row (d1' 0.999154, d2' 0.998710,

(rho_0 0.839, M90 30, top-1 0.275) and the r343 bridge median
1.0058; the r342/r345/r347 fit slopes (margin -3.332, c -0.697, p
-0.754, q -0.645, |c'/c| -2.668, |c'| -3.401, p' -3.422, q'
-3.359, p'/p -2.609, q'/q -2.665) and curvatures (cpc -0.189,
margin -0.347, c +0.308) as DISCLOSED PRIORS; the r343 sealed
EXT3/EXT4 selections adopted AS-IS; the r334/r345 kappa_int
records and control flips.

LEG A -- THE ORDER-0 ANATOMY (sealed clauses): the split identity
T0 + T+ == Delta c at SPLIT_BAR 1e-9 (backward-error scale) and
the bookkeeping identity c'/c == y0 - rho_hi at CPC_ID_BAR 1e-6
per rung on all 75 rows; THE ORDER-0 MISS LAW: sealed r347
decay_law fit of log|y0| vs log N_w on the 57 with halves
curvature and the EXT3/EXT4 band pure tests; ORDER0_LAW iff
|curv| <= 0.35 AND EXT3 in-band >= 10/12 AND EXT4 n_low <= 1 AND
delta_0 >= DELTA0_MIN = 0.3; ORDER0_CARRIES_DELTA iff additionally
|delta_0 - delta| <= CARRY_BAR = 0.5 (the r347-sketch hypothesis
'does u1.u2/c alone already carry the N^-2.67 law?' -- adjudicated
symmetrically); rho_hi gets the same instrument as CENSUS (no
clause -- the s1 scoping shows y0 and rho_hi are BOTH slow ~N^-0.6
and their DIFFERENCE is the c'/c law: the delta cancellation is an
INTER-ORDER near-cancellation, the same motif as the pair itself,
measured by the depth census |c'/c|/y0); the mode census columns
and the sealed DICT_T0 sample clause (bar 0.10, six sample rungs).

LEG B -- THE RATE-EQUALITY CANDIDATE (sealed clauses): toys
(T1) the two-level dressed-scalar identity EXACT in Fractions on
the rank-2 rational model (lam 9/10, 3/10; vectors 3/5, 4/5 --
p' = 121/250, q' = 79/250, c' = 72/250 by hand) AND through the
FULL Schur chain on the block-spectral 4x4 at 1e-12, AND the
two-level reserve cross-tie r'_2 = 1 - c'_2^2/(p'_2 q'_2) ==
4375/9559 == the r345 formula; (T2) the rate toys: a flat-geometry
synthetic family recovers delta_x = alpha - a_x at RATE_TOL 1e-9
with dressed-slope spread 0 (equality HOLDS iff a_p == a_q == a_c,
and an unequal-rate family breaks it by EXACTLY the bare spread);
an angle-drift family (t2 ~ N^tau, tau 0.4) breaks the dressed-
slope equality by >= DRIFT_MIN 0.2 -- the flat-geometry hypothesis
is load-bearing; LIVE (the certificate side, all sealed): (E1)
CURV_FLAT on ALL THREE margin-pinning ratios p'/margin, q'/margin,
|c'|/margin (r345 protocol verbatim over all 75 arbitrated rows);
(E2) the two-level truncation census: median over the 57 of
max(sh_p, sh_q, sh_c) <= SHADOW_MED_BAR 0.20 (sh_x = |x'_2/x' -
1|); (E3) sign agreement of c'_2 with c' on >= SGN_MIN 73 of 75;
(E4) the fitted image of the theorem: max_x |delta_x - (alpha_meas
- a_x)| <= UNIV_BAR 0.1 for x in {p, q, c} (delta_p/delta_q/delta
= the sealed p'/p, q'/q, |c'/c| fits; a_x = the bare fits) -- the
r347 universality census upgraded to the exact prediction
delta_x = alpha - a_x.

LEG C -- THE DECOMPOSITION (sealed): the r347 C4 closure re-gated
(|alpha - (a_c + delta)| <= CLOSURE_BAR 0.1) and TYPED: delta ==
alpha - a_c where the two-level skeleton (exact algebra) plus the
certified margin-pinning flats carry the reduction, alpha and a_c
stay FIT-CENSUS laws (weight side of the bare scalars closed-form,
r342) -- the irreducible measured rest of the L* margin law after
this round is the PAIR {alpha, a_c} (equivalently {alpha, delta}),
one exponent fewer than r342's three, zero new exponents beyond
r347, but delta itself loses its independent-law status if Leg B
certifies; honesty: alpha has NO source derivation
(ALPHA_SOURCE_CLOSED_FORM sealed False -- the DELTA_SOURCE_DERIVED
clause exists so the enum is complete).

LEG D -- WORLDS + TWIN + WEAK RUNGS (sealed): the r347 mirror
world rule re-gated verbatim (8 worlds MAIN/TWIN/EPST/SCR/SMOOTH/
HL2/DIR/ABS; live iff lambda_rest < 1 AND |rho_32 - 1| <= 0.5)
with the NEW order-0 world column rho_0 printed (census, no bar --
the order-0 sum is finite on every world); the rational twin ward
on the new columns (rho_0, y0, shadow devs, T0) at TWIN_BAR 1e-3;
THE WEAK FAMILY: KZ_WEAK = (28, 44, 59) -- the r345 kill-census
suspects (kz28 worst two-level dev 0.4192, kz44 rest-pair-mass
argmin, kz59 pair-mass argmin) as their own row family with
columns (rho_0, sh_p/q/c, K_res, masses); sealed clause:
WEAK_FAMILY_STRAINED iff the median over the family of max(sh_x)
> WEAK_BAR 0.35, else WEAK_FAMILY_SURVIVES (printed per row).

LEG E -- MUST-FAILS (>= 5, each loud): (m1) THE WRONG RESOLVENT
WEIGHT: the enhancement with delta/(1+delta) instead of
delta/(1-delta) -- breaks the exact split identity by >= 0.1 rel
at w9 and >= 1e-6 on the hand toy; exactly CAUGHT.  (m2) MODE
SELECTION AFTER SIGHT: the census quantile re-picked from the seen
share column -- consumes the withheld column; AST-FLAGGED, and the
toy value differs from the sealed M90_Q.  (m3) DELTA_0 READ BACK
from the withheld record exponent -- AST-FLAGGED.  (m4) A
SYNTHETIC MODEL WITH BUILT-IN TARGET: a mutant family planting the
withheld record exponent -- AST-FLAGGED, and the sealed toy
exponents differ from the record value by construction
(construction-CAUGHT).  (m5) THE TWO-LEVEL FORMULA WITH THE WRONG
COUPLING SIGN (g21 a1 a2 - b1 b2) -- breaks c'_2 by >= 0.1 rel
against its own right-sign value at w9 and by 1/3 exactly on the
rational toy.  STOP LIST (anti-gates, binding): NO L* claim, NO
bound mechanism promoted, NO certificate reading of any census, NO
posthoc bar / band / family / prior move, NO derived 5/7, NO RH
claim, mincut unchanged; r243..r347 stand.

PRE-SPEC SCOPING (disclosed, r343-s1/r345-s1/r347-s1 precedent --
no bar, band, threshold, family or adjudication rule was tuned
after any evaluation except as sized here and said so): (s1) FOUR
sample rungs (kz9, kz44, kz56, kz130 -- all four already printed
in the r342/r343/r345/r347 records) were probed end-to-end for
machinery and bar sizing: the order-0 split identity residual
spans 4.9e-15 .. 2.0e-14 (sizing SPLIT_BAR 1e-9); rho_0 = 0.5787 /
0.8290 / 0.8982 / 0.9169 with y0 = 1 - rho_0 = 0.4213 / 0.1710 /
0.1018 / 0.0831 and rho_hi = 0.3943 / 0.1706 / 0.1018 / 0.0831 --
y0 and rho_hi are BOTH slow (naive two-point slopes -0.615 /
-0.590) while their difference c'/c falls at -3.406: THE DELTA LAW
IS AN INTER-ORDER NEAR-CANCELLATION (the sizing observation behind
DELTA0_MIN 0.3 and the CARRY clause; the expected reading is that
order-0 alone does NOT carry delta); two-level dressed-scalar
shadow devs 0.049 .. 0.130 with sign agreement 4/4 (sizing
SHADOW_MED_BAR 0.20, SGN_MIN 73); mode census top-1 0.177..0.297,
M90 27..38, T0 arch-rim atom share 0.844..0.950, top carrying
MODE arch mass 0.157..0.286 and peel-pair mass 0.007..0.014 (the
carriers are NOT the peel-concentrated top rest mode -- disclosed,
re-measured ladder-wide below); dictionary T0 surrogate devs
0.195 (w9) / 0.048 / 0.004 / 0.006 -- depth-improving, w9 is the
honest worst (sizing DICT_T0_BAR 0.10 on the sample median,
sealed symmetric GO/census); margin-pinning ratios p'/m 3.89..
9.13, q'/m 7.70..17.73, |c'|/m 5.21..11.66 (spans 0.35..0.37
decades over the four rungs -- flat O(1) columns with ~x2.3
scatter: exactly the r345 protocol's object class); (s2) the rate
toys were sized: the flat-geometry family recovers delta_x =
alpha - a_x with dressed-slope spread 0.0 (exact powers), the
tau = 0.4 angle-drift family separates the dressed slopes by
0.453 (sizing DRIFT_MIN 0.2); (s3) the rank-2 Fractions model was
solved by hand (p' 121/250, q' 79/250, c' 72/250, r'_2 4375/9559)
-- the toy gates are exact-value gates.  Runtime scoping 5.5 s
total for the four rungs + toys; the full run is sized under the
1800 s bar (the r345 ladder pass with the same extend_rung is
62 s).  No ladder-wide fit, median, protocol clause or law was
evaluated before this spec froze; the slopes cited above are
published record numbers or the disclosed two-point scoping
values, never sealed-fit previews.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';

Honesty before beauty: the order-0 split and the two-level
dressed-scalar identity are exact finite-matrix facts
(theorem-grade SKELETON) whose inputs are measured window scalars
(census-grade FLESH); the rate-equality certificate is a sealed
census protocol on 75 finite windows, never an asymptotic theorem
-- its theorem-grade half lives on the synthetic small models
where the hypotheses (top-2 dominance, flat geometry) are exact;
delta_0, delta and alpha remain measured laws (fit-census with
sealed honesty meters); a reduction delta == alpha - a_c moves the
open analytic remainder, it does not close it: alpha and a_c stay
unexplained from the source (the kernel side has no closed form,
r342 negative #4); the mirror world clause is a measured
discriminator on eight instrumented worlds; no verdict claims L*,
a bound mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any direction.

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
