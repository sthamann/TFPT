r"""critical_saturation_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.DUAL.CRITICAL_SATURATION.01
(round 360): THE CRITICAL SATURATION SCAFFOLD -- reviewer contract L2,
triggered by the r359 ASYMPTOTICS_REQUIRED verdict.  Coexistence: R358
(gap-Carleson, terminal lane) may run in parallel -- this probe touches
NOTHING outside its own file and the strictly additive rh-sync.

THE FROZEN QUESTION (reviewer contract L2, binding): the target theorem
is S_N = N^{-alpha} (M_0 + O(N^{-eps})) with M_0 > 0 explicit, plus the
rest-block clause in RELATIVE form (r359: lambda_min(R_CC) - 1/2 decays
PARALLEL to the margin, rest/eps med 20.3 -- the absolute c_rest N^{-beta}
form is refuted by measurement).  The precise r359 handoff object: the
critical 2x2 Schur block S_N carries the full margin (bind med 1.0058);
the RHP target data are the DIAGONAL dual-resolvent values (A^{-1})_kk
at the critical pair, with the cross share (med 0.702) as the handoff --
the diagonal parametrix alone misses by exactly the cross share.  An
internal round CANNOT deliver the full RHP theorem (typed honestly as
the specialist work); it CAN build and measure the SCAFFOLD: solve the
constrained (BKMM obstacle) equilibrium problem, test the saturation
thesis, calibrate the parametrix-class dimensionless data, seal the
alpha/M_0 census, certify the relative rest clause where it is a
theorem, and type each reviewer step (A)-(E) as theorem / census / open.

THE EXACT OBJECTS OF THE ROUND (every identity a finite-matrix fact):
  (O1 OCCUPATION DUALITY) with u the positive lift weight (r356) and
    u_vee = c_j (1-x)/|f| the Borodin dual weight, the diagonal of the
    rank-N_w eta projection and the diagonal of the rank-(N_w - 1) dual
    hole projection are EXACT complements on every union node:
    o_eta(x_j) + o_dual(x_j) == 1 (D^2 = I on the diagonal of the r356
    complementation); trace ward: sum_j o_dual(x_j) == N_w - 1 exactly.
    o_dual is the exact finite occupation field of the dual ensemble --
    the finite counterpart of the BKMM equilibrium density vs its upper
    constraint, with NO solver and NO asymptotics.
  (O2 THE OBSTACLE PROBLEM, deterministic solver, no fit primitives)
    the zero-temperature constrained equilibrium on the actual grid:
    minimize E(m) = sum_{j != k} m_j m_k log(1/|x_j - x_k|) +
    sum_j m_j (-log u_vee_j) over 0 <= m_j <= 1, sum m_j = N_w - 1
    (the discrete cap IS the BKMM upper constraint; the classical
    UNCONSTRAINED problem is the m1 must-fail).  Solved by sealed FISTA
    (fixed 3000 iterations, deterministic step from 60 power iterations,
    exact box-simplex water-filling projection by 100 bisections); KKT
    partition gates: void/saturated separation gap = min g[void] -
    max g[sat] > 0 with at most NB_MAX unclassified nodes.
  (O3 THE SATURATION THESIS, sealed) the primal (eta) side saturated
    zone at the right hard edge: scoping found the QP dual-VOID block ==
    folds {1, 2, 3} EXACTLY on all four sealed instances (== primal-
    SATURATED block by O1), so the critical pair (folds 2, 4) STRADDLES
    the saturation-block edge 3|4; the exact occupation shows the fold-1
    anomaly o_dual(fold 1) - median <= -ZONE_BAR with the pair folds
    themselves flat -- the pair sits AT the edge of the saturated zone,
    not inside it and not in the bulk.  The chi worlds (far from the
    wall) have NO fold-1 anomaly and their QP occupies fold 1: the
    partition is world-separating (a DIFFERENT partition, not the same
    with different distance).
  (O4 THE PARAMETRIX DATUM) t_geo := eps * sqrt((A^{-1})_11 (A^{-1})_22)
    is dimensionless, exactly = 1/(2 sqrt(det(S_N/eps) (1 - share))) by
    the r359 resolvent-minor identity, and scoping shows it FAMILY-
    CONSTANT at the wander level (0.229 .. 0.265 MAIN, 0.199/0.288 chi)
    -- the diagonal dual-resolvent data are margin-locked local data:
    the local-parametrix-class census (NOT a Gamma-function derivation;
    said hard).
  (O5 ALPHA / M_0) det S_N tracks margin^2 (r359 slope -6.742) and
    lambda_min(S_N)/eps = bind is collapsed in [1.0003, 1.0605]; the
    fresh Theil-Sen slope of log lambda_min(S_N) on the 57 adjudicates
    the sealed alpha candidates (3.332 margin exponent r352 vs 1.65
    s_infty running reading r354); kappa_S = lambda_max/lambda_min =
    det S_N / lambda_min^2 measures the M_0 collapse: strong collapse
    iff range ratio <= 1.5 (honest expectation: the margin direction
    collapses via bind, kappa_S wanders O(1) -- M0_PARTIAL).
  (O6 WANDER CANCELLATION) via the exact r359 adjugate identity
    det S_N * 4 [(A^{-1})_11 (A^{-1})_22 - (A^{-1})_12^2] == 1:
    log det S_N == -log 4 - log(a11 a22) - log(1 - share) POINTWISE;
    the psi57 fine structures of log det S_N and -log(a11 a22) must
    cohere (corr clause) with the share term subleading (rms census) --
    the leading common wander lives in the diagonal resolvent data and
    cancels algebraically in the minor, measured not assumed.
  (O7 THE RELATIVE REST CLAUSE) lambda_min(R_CC) - 1/2 >= c (lambda_min
    (R) - 1/2): c = 1 is the CAUCHY EIGENVALUE INTERLACING THEOREM
    (principal submatrix; likewise lambda_min(S_N) >= lambda_min(M) by
    the Schur-complement eigenvalue inequality -- both exact finite
    theorems, gated live and on the toy); c >= C_REL = 2.0 is the sealed
    census over ALL live resolvable rows of MAIN + chi3 + chi4 -- the
    L2 clause in provable-shape (theorem at c = 1, census margin at 2).

THE LEGS: (Leg 0) anchors bit-near: the r359 records (W9 eps 4.1882e-5,
lamS 4.2003e-5, detS 2.0690e-8, share 0.6973, folds (2, 4); share
samples kz44/56/130; detS slope -6.742; rest slope -3.276; bind clause
[1 - 1e-6, 1.5]), the r356 records (lambda_min(R) 0.500041882, margin
1.6752e-4), the r352 margin slope -3.332, the r354 s_infty 1.65 reading
(candidate only), the r350 exponent family (1.786/1.683 Christoffel,
0.38 family) as census comparison prints.  (Leg A) the constrained
equilibrium problem (reviewer step B): O1 + O2 + O3 on the sealed QP
instances kz 9/44/56/130 + chi3 w9 + chi4 w9 + scramble w9; the
partition clause, the straddle clause, the KKT gates, the chi contrast.
(Leg B) the parametrix calibration (step C as census): O4 sealed band +
slope clauses on the resolvable rows, the exponent censi of |a11|,
|a22|, |a12| printed against the sealed candidate families.  (Leg C)
the alpha/M_0 structure (step D as census): O5 sealed alpha
adjudication with BOTH candidates, kappa_S band + collapse ratio,
split-half curvature print (curvature-honest), plus O6 as the wander-
cancellation probe.  (Leg D) the relative rest clause O7.  (Leg E)
worlds + must-fails: matched SCRAMBLE (r359 named break at R_CC
reproduced: eps -0.4962, rest -0.4962, pair block +1.369e-2 stays
positive; occupation/QP census printed), rational TWIN (dose-zero
bitwise + occupation pointwise devs), chi3/chi4 ladders through the
identical pipeline (42 rungs each: chain wards + rest/eps min +
occupation flatness census).

MUST-FAILS (6): (m1) the UNCONSTRAINED (classical) equilibrium problem
-- cap removed: the minimizer piles max m = 92.7 (w9, scoped) onto
single nodes, >= M1_BAR 10 x the discrete cap -> CAUGHT (wrong class:
the obstacle constraint is load-bearing); (m2) alpha read from the
withheld margin column -> AST-CAUGHT; (m3) M_0 'fit by sight' -- the
posthoc alpha optimizer reading the withheld det S_N column ->
AST-CAUGHT (the sealed-candidate protocol is the catch); (m4) the
parametrix 'prediction' returning the withheld (A^{-1})_11 column ->
AST-CAUGHT; (m5) the partition with weight SHUFFLE (deterministic
reversal of u_vee): the fold-1 occupation moves by 0.798 (scoped) >=
M5_BAR 0.3 -> CAUGHT; (m6) the occupation complement with WRONG RANK
(N_w instead of N_w - 1): breaks by 1.17e-2 >= M6_BAR 1e-3 at w9 AND
exactly on the Fractions toy -> CAUGHT.

PRE-SPEC SCOPING (disclosed, r343-s1..r359-s1 precedent -- TWO sizing
passes s1/s2 on kz9/44/56/130 + kz18/52/82/119/42 (occupation only) +
chi3/chi4 w9 + scramble w9, /tmp, deleted; no bar, band, clause,
candidate list or verdict rule was tuned after any evaluation except
as sized here and said so): the occupation duality is exact (complement
dev 3.7e-13 (w9) .. 2.2e-11 (S 4035), trace exact to 1e-10); THE
FOLD-1 ANOMALY IS FAMILY-UNIFORM: o_dual(fold 1) = 0.150 (w9), 0.186
(kz18), 0.214 (kz44), 0.219 (kz52), 0.224 (kz56), 0.236 (kz82), 0.249
(kz119), 0.218 (kz42), 0.252 (kz130) against bulk medians 0.48..0.51
-- always the SINGLE anomalous right-edge fold, the pair folds flat
(devs <= 0.04); the anomaly DECAYS SLOWLY if at all (ln(0.5 - od1)
slope ~ -0.12 on the four scoped depths -- census column, no sealed
candidate); THE QP CRYSTALLIZES at 3000 iterations (zero-temperature
ground state, #band 0..2, KKT gap +0.092 .. +2.72) with the dual void
block EXACTLY {1, 2, 3} on all four MAIN instances -- the pair (2, 4)
straddles the block edge 3|4; chi3/chi4/scramble OCCUPY fold 1 (m
fold1 = 1.0); the exact-occupation chi contrast: |od1 - med| = 0.035
(chi3) / 0.026 (chi4) -- no anomaly; scramble od1 0.6061, med 0.474
(disordered, dev +0.13 below the zone bar); t_geo = 0.2646 (w9),
0.2431/0.2449/0.2294 (samples), 0.1987/0.2875 (chi w9) -- the band and
slope clauses sized from these plus the exact t_geo relation; the m1
unconstrained catch is loud on every instance (max m 92.7 (w9) ..
1624 (kz130)); m5 shuffle moves od1 by 0.798; m6 wrong rank breaks the
complement by 1.17e-2 vs 3.7e-13 true.  The verdict letters, clauses,
bands and every bar were frozen from these numbers BEFORE any
ladder-wide, chi-ladder-wide, fit-side or adjudication evaluation.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';
precedence TARGET_LEAK > SUPPORT_GATE_FAIL > CHAIN_FAIL > the four
adjudicated letters -- the enum is exhaustive):
  TARGET_LEAK(loci)  iff any firewall/scope/fragment audit fails /
  SUPPORT_GATE_FAIL(rows)  iff the rank/support gate fails on any real
    MAIN ladder window /
  CHAIN_FAIL(loci)  iff any exact ward fails (toys, r359 E1-E5 graded,
    occupation complement, trace, QP KKT gates, equivalence on
    resolvable rows, Jacobi order) /
  otherwise ALL FOUR adjudications, each exactly one letter:
  [SATURATION_EDGE_CONFIRMED(straddle)  iff the QP void block ==
    {1, 2, 3} with KKT gates on 4/4 sealed instances AND the MAIN
    occupation zone census >= 83/85 (fold-1 anomaly + pair flat) AND
    the chi contrast (both chi w9 flat AND both chi QPs occupy fold 1)
    / SATURATION_REFUTED(loci)  otherwise -- honest: a different local
    class is needed]
  [GAMMA_PARAMETRIX_CENSUS(t_geo)  iff |TS slope(log t_geo)| <= 0.10
    on the 57 AND t_geo in (0.10, 0.45) on ALL resolvable MAIN rows
    AND both chi w9 values in band -- the dimensionless diagonal-
    resolvent datum is family-constant: local-parametrix-class census,
    NOT a Gamma derivation / GAMMA_CENSUS_OFF(loci)]
  [M0_COLLAPSE(alpha)  iff the fresh lamS slope hits a sealed alpha
    candidate at 0.10 AND kappa_S range ratio <= 1.5 on the resolvable
    rows / M0_PARTIAL(alpha)  iff the alpha candidate hits AND kappa_S
    in (5, 60) on all resolvable rows (the margin direction collapses
    via the bind clause, the second eigenvalue is bounded O(1) wander)
    / M0_OFF(slope)]
  [RELATIVE_REST_CERTIFIED(theorem c=1, census c>=2)  iff the
    interlacing theorem side holds (toy exact + live 74/74 resolvable)
    AND rest/eps >= C_REL on ALL live resolvable rows of MAIN + chi3 +
    chi4 / REST_RELATIVE_CENSUS(min)]
  + WANDER_CANCEL_LEDGER(O6 corr + rms census) + PARTITION_LEDGER +
    OCCUPATION_LEDGER + WORLD_LEDGER + TWIN_LEDGER +
    SCRAMBLE_BREAK(named) + MUSTFAIL_LEDGER [always].
Honesty before beauty: the occupation duality, the trace, the adjugate
decomposition and the interlacing inequalities are exact finite-matrix
facts (theorem-grade SKELETON) whose inputs are measured window scalars
(census-grade FLESH); the QP is a zero-temperature variational model --
its partition is a measurement about THIS family, not an asymptotic
theorem; t_geo family-constancy is a census, the Gamma-parametrix
DERIVATION stays open (the specialist step C); no verdict claims L*, a
bound mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any direction; the
DCCX STOP list stands.

RECORD TABLES: inserted AFTER the record run only (two-commit
protocol, r329 convention; the pre-freeze spec ends here -- no
placeholder numbers before the first full evaluation, the r346
lesson).

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
