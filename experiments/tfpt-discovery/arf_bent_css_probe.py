r"""arf_bent_css_probe -- ARF.BENT.CSS.01: the bent phase code and the
two CSS codes.  The phase vector s_q = (-1)^{q*} is a bent function
with Walsh identity s_q-hat = -4 s_q (the Gauss sum -2^{4/2} = -4 as
an eigenvalue equation), its zero set is a (16,6,2) Hadamard
difference set {0} u ovoid, the linear span A_q = <V*, q*> = [15,5,6]
is self-orthogonal inside C_iso and yields the CSS code [[15,5,3]],
the 16-slot extension A_16 = RM(1,4) + <q*> = [16,6,6] yields
[[16,4,4]] whose dual's 60 minimal words are EXACTLY the 60 isotropic
affine planes, and the Hecke difference a_3 = -4, the Gauss sum and
the Walsh eigenvalue are ONE machine-checked integer (finite-geometry
module 3 of the 2026-08-07 evening code-complex round).

FROZEN CLAIMS (2026-08-07, frozen + SHA-hashed before first run; all
statements verified over ALL objects, never samples; exact integer/F2
arithmetic; no floats, no RNG, no fits):

 S1  CARRIER: corpus form hb (J - I Gram), 16 refinements (2^16
     census), Arf 6 + 10, selector-unique q* (Arf 1); five = {q*=0}
     \{0} (the ovoid), ten = {q*=1}; s_q(x) = (-1)^{q*(x)}.

 S2  (a) THE GAUSS-SUM / WALSH IDENTITY:
     (i)  the one-line identity q*(x) + hb(a,x) = q*(x+a) + q*(a)
          holds on ALL 256 pairs (the derivation identity re-read);
     (ii) the exact integer Walsh transform obeys s_q-hat(a) =
          sum_x s_q(x) (-1)^{hb(a,x)} = -4 * s_q(a) for ALL 16 a --
          s_q is a Walsh EIGENVECTOR with eigenvalue -4 (bent,
          extremal); W^2 = 16 I for the character matrix W;
     (iii) perfect autocorrelation sum_x s_q(x+a) s_q(x+b) =
          16 delta_{a,b} on ALL 256 pairs.

 S3  (b) THE DIFFERENCE SET: D_q = {q* = 0} has 6 elements = {0} u
     the five carrier points (each of iota-weight 4 -- identified
     against the five-slot structure; the 5bar meets every doily
     line exactly once); |D_q n (D_q + a)| = 2 for ALL 15 a != 0 --
     the (16,6,2) Hadamard difference set.

 S4  (c) THE PHASE CODE A_q = C_iso^perp = <V*, q*> = [15,5,6]:
     A_q = span{hb(v,.)|_NZ} + <q*|_NZ> has dim 5, weight enumerator
     1 + 10z^6 + 15z^8 + 6z^10, min distance 6; A_q == C_iso^perp
     (set equality, C_iso = the Arf-kernel [15,10,3] of the Hamming
     code, probe-1 pencil); THE 31-WORD SEMANTIC CENSUS, each class
     identified STRUCTURALLY (set equalities, not counts): the 15
     weight-8 words ARE the linear characters hb(v,.), the 10
     weight-6 words ARE the Arf-0 (even) refinement indicators, the
     6 weight-10 words ARE the Arf-1 (odd/ovoid) refinement
     indicators.

 S5  (d1) CSS CODE ONE: A_q c A_q^perp = C_iso (self-orthogonality,
     all 32 x 32 pairs even) => [[15, 5, 3]] with k = 15 - 2*5 =
     dim C_iso - dim A_q = 5 and d = 3: the coset minimum is
     realized by the 15 explicit weight-3 isotropic-line words of
     C_iso (set equality), none of which lies in A_q (min weight 6),
     and C_iso has NO weight-1 or weight-2 word.

 S6  (d2) CSS CODE TWO: A_16 = RM(1,4) + <q*> = [16,6,6] with weight
     enumerator 1 + 16z^6 + 30z^8 + 16z^10 + z^16, SELF-ORTHOGONAL;
     dual C_16 = A_16^perp = [16,10,4] = {c in RM(2,4) : c.q* = 0}
     (set equality); the 60 minimal (weight-4) words of C_16 are
     EXACTLY the 60 isotropic affine planes = 15 through the origin
     + 45 off (SET EQUALITY -- the syndrome-table cross-link: these
     are precisely the s_Arf = 0 rows of probe 1) => [[16, 4, 4]]
     with k = 16 - 2*6 = 4 and d = 4 (weight-4 words exist in C_16
     and none lies in A_16).

 S7  (d3) THE VACUUM TRANSFORMATION [[15,5,3]] -> [[16,4,4]] typed:
     shortening A_16 at the vacuum coordinate == A_q and puncturing
     C_16 == C_iso (set equalities); one physical slot added
     (n 15 -> 16), one logical qubit paid (k 5 -> 4), distance
     bought (d 3 -> 4).

 S8  (e) THE -4 TRIPLE POINT, one machine-checked statement:
     (i)   Hecke: the per-point plane census (12 isotropic - 16
           non-isotropic off-origin planes through x, re-counted at
           ALL 15 points) gives A_3 - B_3 = -4 = a_3 (eta product
           rebuilt inline; v820 S4.2 (G3) / v535 corpus anchors);
     (ii)  Gauss: sum_x s_q(x) = 6 - 10 = -4 = -2^{4/2};
     (iii) Walsh: the eigenvalue of s_q under W is -4 (S2);
     all three integers computed independently and asserted EQUAL.
     THE 16-TRANSLATE HADAMARD BASIS vs the corpus torsor Fourier
     basis (v800, integer Gram 16 I, mutually-unbiased honest cap):
     the translates T_t = s_q(. + t) have Gram EXACTLY 16 I (an
     orthogonal Hadamard basis, same normalization as v800's rays),
     and are MUTUALLY UNBIASED against the 16 characters
     (-1)^{hb(u,.)}: ALL 256 cross inner products = +-4 = sqrt(16)
     -- the translate basis does NOT reproduce the character rays,
     it is their unbiased complement (typed REPORT, v800 cited).

 C   CONTROLS (must fire; frozen fire rules):
     C1 ARF-0 REFINEMENT q0: the Walsh identity flips sign,
        s_q0-hat = +4 s_q0 on ALL 16 (eigenvalue +4), and the zero
        set is NOT a (16,6,2) set: |{q0=0}| = 10 with all 15
        intersection sizes = 6 (the complementary (16,10,6) set --
        census printed).
     C2 DOT FORM: zero quadratic refinements (2^16 census) -- no
        bent seed exists; the direction bit is ill-defined (witness
        U = <e1,e2>); and the dot-side parity surrogate collapses:
        wt(x) mod 2 IS the linear character x1+x2+x3+x4 in RM(1,4),
        so span(RM(1,4) + <parity>) has dim 5 != 6 -- NO sixth
        generator, no [16,6,6], the self-orthogonal extension dies.

KILLS (any one fires => typed failure):
  K1 Walsh / Gauss / autocorrelation identity breaks -> WALSH-BROKEN
  K2 the (16,6,2) difference set breaks              -> DIFFSET-BROKEN
  K3 A_q census / dual / semantic identification     -> CODE-CENSUS-BROKEN
  K4 a CSS ingredient ([[15,5,3]] / [[16,4,4]])      -> CSS-BROKEN
  K5 the vacuum shorten/puncture map breaks          -> VACUUM-MAP-BROKEN
  K6 the -4 triple point / 16I / MUB check breaks    -> TRIPLE-POINT-BROKEN
  K7 a control does not fire                         -> CONTROL-DEAD

VERDICT (frozen enum): ARF-BENT-CSS-EXACT / WALSH-BROKEN /
DIFFSET-BROKEN / CODE-CENSUS-BROKEN / CSS-BROKEN / VACUUM-MAP-BROKEN /
TRIPLE-POINT-BROKEN / CONTROL-DEAD.
