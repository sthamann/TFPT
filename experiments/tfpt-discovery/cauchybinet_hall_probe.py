r"""cauchybinet_hall_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.CAUCHYBINET_HALL_TRANSPORT.01
(round 340): the WEIGHTED CAUCHY-BINET TRANSPORT -- the new L*
base architecture after both pre-authorized norm-bound arms were
measured and capped (r334 capacity: the structural ceiling
kappa x C_lev = 1.0085 >= lambda_max -- every factorization "load
on level sets x universal level cost" loses more at the extremal
direction than the whole wall margin; r336 parity:
PARITY_WORLD_BLIND -- the local symbol/Fejer geometry does not
decide the wall).  Reviewer conclusion (binding): the L* defect
is neither a level-set nor a local frequency problem -- it lives
in the FULL SIGNED CONFIGURATION, visible on the extremal side
through the sharp two-atom structure (r284, the shallow-edge pair
folds 2/4).  The new idea class: NO norm bound -- TRANSPORT: pair
the negative determinant configurations with heavier positive
ones.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO promotion,
NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO RH CLAIM in either direction.
Coexistence: rounds 337/338/339 may run in parallel -- this probe
touches NOTHING outside its own file and the strictly additive
rh-sync (existing entries byte-identical).

THE EXACT STARTING IDENTITY (Cauchy-Binet, signed; classical):
for the signed defect source mutilde = sum_j w_j delta_{x_j}
(S atoms, x strictly ascending, w signed) and the Hankel matrix
H_n(mutilde) = (m_{i+j})_{i,j<n} with m_r = sum_j w_j x_j^r:
    D_n = det H_n = sum_{|I|=n} (prod_{i in I} w_i) Delta(x_I)^2,
Delta(x_I) the Vandermonde of the positions of I.  With W(I) =
(prod |w_i|) Delta(x_I)^2 > 0 and eps(I) = (-1)^{#(I cap N_-)}:
    D_n = sum_{E_n} W - sum_{O_n} W
(E_n/O_n = size-n configurations with an even/odd number of
negative atoms).  By Sylvester, H_{N} > 0 (PD) iff D_n > 0 for
all n <= N, and for the L* window (N = N_w = (S+1)/2) this IS
lemma L* verbatim (int p^2 dnu < int p^2 dmu for deg p < N_w
iff a^T H_{N_w} a > 0 for all a != 0).  L* therefore reduces to
the family of weighted inequalities
    sum_{O_n} W < sum_{E_n} W   for all n <= N_w.

THE TRANSPORT CANDIDATE (the round's object): a flow T_n(I, J)
>= 0 (I in O_n, J in E_n, only along ADMISSIBLE edges) with
sum_J T_n(I, J) = W(I) for every I and sum_I T_n(I, J) <= W(J)
for every J, plus strict reserve somewhere ==> D_n > 0 for all
n ==> (Sylvester) H_{N_w} PD ==> L*.  By max-flow/min-cut the
existence of T_n is EXACTLY the weighted Hall condition
    sum_{I in A} W(I) <= sum_{J in Gamma(A)} W(J)
                                     for every A subset O_n.
The central structural hypothesis of the round (INTERVAL HALL
REDUCTION, a genuinely new candidate theorem, tested FIRST on
exact small models): on the canonical fold-exchange graph every
minimal weighted Hall cut is realized by an ordered interval
family / an ideal in the Gale order (plausible from the
one-dimensional Vandermonde geometry).  Then the r334 coordinate
1 - kappa_int would not be the first factor of a lossy level-set
inequality but the DUAL SLACK of a Hall cut -- the r334 ceiling
kappa x C_lev >= 1.0085 does NOT touch this route (no C_lev is
multiplied).  The r282 Kasteleyn no-go is RESPECTED: no sign
gauge, no termwise positivization, no value-true involution --
a weight-dependent many-to-many transport between configurations
of different weight (the m4 mutant documents the distinction
exactly).

THE ADMISSIBLE EDGES (source-pure, sealed BEFORE the freeze):
an elementary edge replaces exactly ONE negative atom y in I by
one of its canonical positive fold companions x not in I:
I -> J = I \ {y} u {x}.  CANONICAL COMPANIONS (sealed): the
union in descending x IS the fold order (x_f = cos(2 pi f / L)
is strictly decreasing in the fold index f <= L/2 -- gated on
w9), so position adjacency == fold adjacency; the companions of
a negative atom y are the nearest mu atoms strictly left and
strictly right of y in the x-sorted union.  OCCUPANCY REMEDY
(the reviewer's "two steps / double exchange", sealed): if a
companion is already in I, step outward to the next free mu atom
on the same side, at most CB_STEP = 2 free mu atoms per side.
The relation is defined ONLY by node order, fold ancestry and
source signs; the exact weight ratio on every edge is
    W(J)/W(I) = (|w_x|/|w_y|)
                x prod_{z in I \ {y}} ((x - z)/(y - z))^2
(gated bit-equal in Fractions on the toys and every small-model
edge, f64 log-gated on sampled w9 configurations).  FORBIDDEN
in every constructor: the top eigen direction, the wall margin,
any per-window post-optimized edge library, any posthoc
selection of successful companions (AST scope audit + the
m2/m3 mutants prove the audit bites).

INDEX FIREWALL (binding, r238-r337 discipline): w = window, S =
#union atoms, S_+/S_- = #mu/#nu atoms, N_w = (S+1)//2, minC =
first n with h_n < 0, crossing = minC + 1 (r283 dictionary);
D_n = det H_n(mutilde) with h_n = D_{n+1}/D_n up to
normalization -- D_n > 0 for n <= N_w is the free-window
statement itself.  Ground truth (r283/r284/r334 records, control
flips, the r334 1 - kappa_int record column) enters GATES and
record tables only; the sealed constructors consume atom
positions / signed weights / node order ONLY (AST scope audit);
no zero/prime oracles anywhere (AST firewall).  MACHINERY

LEG 0 -- ANCHORS: w9 records through the document pipeline
(S = 367 = 263 + 104, N_w = 184, lambda_max(E_184) = 0.99983248,
lambda at 185 = 1.00003660, margin 1.6752e-4); the campaign
channel cross-gate (BL union == V union, minC = 184); the r284
shallow edge (the two smallest-theta nu atoms are folds 2/4 --
gated, and identified INSIDE the edge model as the two extremal
atoms); the r334 coordinate 1 - kappa_int as a SEALED COMPARISON
COLUMN (record values 4.8e-4 / 4.3e-4 / 2.6e-5 / 9e-6 at
kz18/kz9/kz60/kz52 -- reporting only, never recomputed, never
consumed).

LEG A -- signed_cauchy_binet EXACT: (a1) hand toy x =
(-1/2, 0, 1/2), w = (1, -1/3, 1): D_1 = 5/3, D_2 = 5/6 with the
parity split E = 1 / O = 1/6, and D_3 = -1/48 < 0 -- the wall in
miniature exactly one degree past the half-filling window N = 2;
the transport at n = 2 by hand: both odd pairs {-1/2, 0} and
{0, 1/2} map to the single even pair {-1/2, 1/2} through the
companion swaps, load 1/6 <= capacity 1, reserve = D_2 = 5/6;
the hand ratio W({-1/2,1/2})/W({-1/2,0}) = 12 = (1/(1/3)) x
((1/2+1/2)/(0+1/2))^2 -- all bit-equal in Fractions.  (a2) JF9
(r230 verbatim, S = 9, S_- = 3): D_n = sum_E W - sum_O W ==
det H_n bit-equal in Fractions for every n <= 5.  (a3) the r334
instances I2/I3/I4 as signed unions (S = 10/12/14): the identity
bit-equal for every n <= N = 5/6/7 (full enumeration, up to
C(14,7) = 3432 configurations); Sylvester cross-gate: the
rational LDL pivots of H_N equal D_n/D_{n-1} exactly.  (a4) w9
LIVE: D_1 and D_2 in EXACT Fractions on all 367 atoms (67161
pair configurations) == m_0 and m_0 m_2 - m_1^2 bit-equal;
where enumeration is impossible the identity is carried by the
sampled ratio ward (a5): CFG_DRAWS = 8 deterministic golden
configurations of size 6 (world-blind index draws, sealed
negative-atom completion rule), every admissible exchange edge
checked in f64 log space |log W(J) - log W(I) - log ratio| <=
1e-8, plus ONE exact Fraction spot check bit-equal.

LEG B -- canonical_exchange_graph: the companion map and the
edge set sealed as above (printed before any flow result); the
w9 fold anchoring gated (union descending-x order == ascending
fold order on the edge prefix; the two extremal nu atoms are
folds 2/4 == r284/r336 record); the exact ratio formula gated on
EVERY edge of the exact small models (bit-equal, Fractions).

LEG C -- THE OPTIMAL TRANSPORT ON SMALL MODELS (the core): the
sealed model family: TOY (S = 3), F1 (S = 6, S_- = 2), F2
(S = 7, S_- = 2), I1 = JF9 (S = 9, S_- = 3), I2/I3/I4 (r334
verbatim, S = 10/12/14), W9EDGE / TWINEDGE / EPSTEDGE / SCREDGE
/ SMOOTHEDGE (the S0 = 12 largest-x union atoms of the real
world = the shallow-edge prefix, weights as EXACT dyadic
Fractions of the builder floats; prefix extended by at most 6
atoms until >= 2 nu atoms; model depth N0 = (S0+1)//2).  Per
model and per n <= N: full configuration enumeration (census
gate #masks == C(S, n)), exact W and parity, D_n == E - O ==
det H_n bit-equal, PD typing (live iff D_n > 0 for all n <= N);
the canonical exchange graph; EXACT integer max-flow (Dinic on
the lcm-scaled capacities -- every W is rational, dyadic on the
real-world models) at every n with |O_n| <= FLOW_CAP = 700
(larger loci typed FLOW_SKIPPED, sealed size rule, loci
printed); coverage iff flow == sum_O W; if coverage fails the
residual-reachable source set A* is extracted and its Hall
violation certified in EXACT Fractions.  THE FIVE REVIEWER
TESTS: (1) EXTREMAL CARRIER -- on W9EDGE at n = N0: the
W-mass fraction of the binding dual cut carried by
configurations containing BOTH extremal atoms (folds 2/4);
carried iff >= 0.9; (2) TWIN FORM -- the binding cut of
TWINEDGE has the same generator (index-matched) and the dual
slack agrees to 1e-3 rel; (3) CONTROLS -- EPST/SCR/SMOOTH edge
models: is the model window already sign-broken (some D_n <= 0,
n <= N0 << flip 25/21/27)?; (4) interval_hall_reduction -- on
the FULLY ENUMERABLE models (TOY/F1/F2: |O_n| <= 20, |E_n| <=
18): ALL 2^|O_n| - 1 Hall sets enumerated (float prescan +
exact Fraction recertification of every tie within 1e-6 rel);
is every exact argmin cut a Gale-order ideal (down- or up-set,
orientation printed), and does the principal-ideal family
attain the exact minimum?; (5) SOURCE SUFFICIENCY -- does the
elementary edge set (1-step + the sealed 2-step occupancy
remedy) cover the full odd mass on every live model at every
n, or is the source structurally too poor
(SOURCE_EXCHANGE_INSUFFICIENT)?  On models beyond the full-
enumeration caps the dual slack is measured on the sealed
PRINCIPAL GALE IDEAL FAMILY (all down-ideals {I <= J0} and
up-ideals {I >= J0}, J0 in O_n, plus the full set; exact
recertification of the argmin) -- an UPPER bound of the true
minimal surplus, honest direction disclosed; the flow coverage
itself stays EXACT.

LEG D -- THE SCALING PROBE: per ladder rung (the 42 admissible
frame-A windows, campaign channel), the S0 = 10 shallow-edge
model at n = N0L = 5: exact coverage + the principal-ideal dual
slack, normalized hall_w = delta_fam / sum_E W; compared
GATE-SIDE against 1 - lambda_max(N_w) per rung (FS chain route)
and against the r334 record column 1 - kappa_int at kz18/9/60/
52.  CONCORDANCE RULE (sealed): FLOW_RESTATEMENT iff hall_w > 0
on every rung AND spread(log10(hall_w / margin)) <= 0.5 AND
|spearman| >= 0.75 (the dual slack is the spectral margin in
disguise); else NEW_COORDINATE (spread + spearman printed).

LEG E -- WARDS / MUST-FAILS (each loud): (m1) RATIO WITHOUT THE
SQUARE: the mutant ratio (prod |(x-z)/(y-z)| unsquared) must
break the exact toy ratio (Fractions, difference exactly
nonzero) -- CAUGHT; (m2) EDGE LIBRARY POST-OPTIMIZED PER
WINDOW: a mutant re-picking companions AFTER SIGHT of the
coverage table consumes the withheld coverage object -- FLAGGED
by the AST scope audit AND on the toy it returns a different
companion set than the sealed rule -- CAUGHT twice; (m3)
TRANSPORT CONSUMES THE TARGET: a mutant orienting the flow by
the withheld lambda record is FLAGGED by the AST scope audit;
(m4) KASTELEYN CONFUSION (r282 respected): the sign gauge
sigma = sign w changes the VALUE of D_n by exactly
2 sum_O W != 0 (Fractions, exact) -- a termwise positivization
is never value-true on a signed window; the transport moves
MASS between DIFFERENT configurations instead -- structurally
documented CAUGHT; (m5) INCOMPLETE CUT ENUMERATION: a mutant
Hall enumerator dropping the full mask is CAUGHT by the census
gate (count == 2^|O| - 1), and the configuration census gate
(#masks == C(S, n)) guards the subset side.  STOP LIST
(anti-gates, binding): NO L* claim, NO bound mechanism, NO
transport promoted as a certificate, NO posthoc edge library,
NO derived 5/7, NO RH claim; r243..r339 stand; mincut base 4 /
refined 5 UNCHANGED.

r283/r284/r334/r336 record numbers (S counts, lambda records,
flips, shallow folds, the 1 - kappa_int column) are consumed as
sealed gate anchors and comparison prints only; the Cauchy-Binet
identity, the Sylvester dictionary, the edge weight-ratio
formula and the max-flow = Hall duality are classical algebra,
disclosed above; GENUINELY OPEN quantities of this round: every
coverage bit, every dual slack, the cut anatomy (extremal
fraction, Gale ideality, family attainment), the control edge
signs, the twin form and the concordance column -- NONE was
computed before this spec was frozen; the model family, the
companion rule, every cap/bar and the verdict tree were fixed at
design time from the published record geometry BEFORE any
machinery pass of this probe.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';
TARGET_LEAK overrides everything on any constructor scope hit):
  [exactly one of] INTERVAL_HALL_CARRIER(on every fully
    enumerated model and n: every exact argmin Hall cut is a
    Gale ideal AND the principal-ideal family attains the exact
    minimum) / CUT_REDUCTION_FAIL(loci)
  + [exactly one of] WEIGHTED_FLOW_GO(coverage at every n <= N
    on every live model, exact, with the strict reserve D_n > 0)
    / SOURCE_EXCHANGE_INSUFFICIENT(loci: model, n, uncovered
    share, exact violating Hall witness)
  + EXTREMAL_CUT(W9EDGE binding-cut anatomy: W-fraction on
    configurations containing both fold-2/4 atoms; generator)
    [always]
  + [exactly one of] TRANSPORT_WORLD_SEEN(every dead edge model
    sign-breaks at some n <= N0 while the live edge models stay
    PD) / TRANSPORT_WORLD_BLIND(loci)
  + [exactly one of] FLOW_RESTATEMENT(spread, spearman) /
    NEW_COORDINATE(spread, spearman, loci)
  + TWIN_LEDGER(dual-slack rel dev, cut form) [always].
Honesty before beauty: the Cauchy-Binet split, the Sylvester
dictionary, the ratio formula and max-flow = Hall are EXACT
COORDINATES of the open scalar L*, not a proof; a passing
coverage is a measured transport on FINITE models (shallow-edge
prefixes and rational instances), never a certificate for the
full window; the principal-ideal slack on large models is an
upper bound of the true minimal surplus (disclosed); a passing
world clause is a consistency statement about the instrumented
edge models, not a discriminator theorem; no verdict claims L*,
a bound mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any
direction.

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
