r"""h3_cofinal_probe -- PRIME.H3.COFINAL.01

FROZEN SPEC (2026-08-20).  EXPLORATION ONLY.  This probe writes no
verification module, paper, ledger, website, manifest, Lean file or
status marker.  It makes NO RH claim, NO positivity claim beyond the
per-rung certificates stated, NO counterexample claim.  It closes no
gate and narrows no gate.

=======================================================================
MISSION (THE H3 COFINAL PROOF ATTACK: after r172/CDLXXXVIII pinned the
entire lambda-uniform residue of the delta-chain to H3-COFINAL
[y_t <= 0.155 T_z^4 at one rung per dyadic block, all blocks], this
round attacks the three named mechanisms: (C1) THE SATURATION
MECHANISM -- is the measured theta_y saturation 0.0449 -> 0.0779 real
(not a fit-window artifact), does the local growth exponent descend
to the exact quartic, does the two-sided lock + the r162/v926 FULLGAP
quartic law imply a theta_y ceiling (consumption FLAGGED-MEASURED,
never silently), and does a source-classical theta_inf exist (priced,
not claimed); (C2) THE COFINAL WEAKENING -- can block-average +
pigeonhole carry H3-cofinal below the pointwise demand (the r166
BA1-BA3 instrument family), or is the averaging subsidy empty for a
saturating positive level observable; (C3) THE WITNESS BOUNDARY --
which certified constraints does the r156/r172 inflation witness
break (exact list, gated), does the certified manifold {ground-state
certificate + two-sided lock + BA3 bridge} EXCLUDE the witness, is
the exclusion stable under a J2-repairing escalation witness, and
what is the Davis-Kahan-class norm-stability radius of H3 on the
certified manifold; (C4) ASSEMBLY -- the exact post-round residue.)

C1 -- THE SATURATION MECHANISM (S3c, G40-G43)
=======================================================================
(i) FIT ADJUDICATION (G40): five frozen 2-parameter models on the
CITED r172 theta ladder (25 rungs h = 4..28, holdout h = 30 excluded
from every fit): POW theta = C h^{p-4} (p from the yt_l10 LSQ);
SATq: theta = t_inf - a h^{-q}, q in {0.5, 1, 2}; LOG theta = t_inf
- a/log h.  Calibrated (pass 1, deterministic on frozen data): POW
RSS 3.0574e-4 holdout +0.00404 (p_all 4.1821); SATq0.5 t_inf
0.094217 RSS 1.7711e-4 hold +0.00159; SATq1 t_inf 0.082368 RSS
1.2712e-4 hold +0.00030; SATq2 t_inf 0.076602 RSS 1.2761e-4 hold
-0.00179; LOG t_inf 0.097708 RSS 1.2677e-4 hold +0.00076.  GATES:
every saturating RSS <= 0.60 x POW RSS; every saturating |holdout|
<= 0.60 x |POW holdout|; every t_inf in TINF_BAND = (0.070, 0.105)
(all limits <= THETA_BAR/1.476); best-RSS model is saturating.
VERDICT CLASS: SATURATION-REAL-NOT-FIT-ARTIFACT.  RECORDED, NOT
CLAIMED (anti-numerology firewall, v354/v355/t0~30 discipline):
4 pi t_inf = 1.1840/1.0351/0.9626/1.2278 across models -- the
candidate theta_inf == 1/(4 pi) = 0.079577 lies INSIDE the model
band; the band is too wide to pin it; NO window is derived from it;
a classical theta_inf needs a Gonek/Montgomery-class second-moment
evaluation of the census source: typed OPEN, same epistemic slot as
GONEK-CONSTANT-UNPRICED.
(ii) LOCAL EXPONENT DESCENT (G41): windowed LSQ slopes of the cited
yt_l10 ladder: W1 [4..13] 4.2991, W2 [10..20] 4.1203, W3 [16..26]
4.0600, W4 [22..28] 4.0236 (W5 [24..30] 4.0404 reported, holdout
inside): gates: strict descent W1 > W2 > W3 > W4 and W4 in (3.95,
4.10): the growth law converges to the EXACT QUARTIC at depth --
the saturation of theta_y IS p_loc -> 4 (the 4.18 all-rung exponent
is an early-transient mixture).
(iii) RATE DICTIONARY TIGHTENED (G42): a_pred_deep = p_W4/2 - 1 =
1.0118 vs the r171 record a = 1.057: |diff| = 0.0452 <= 0.093 (the
r172 gap -- the dictionary closes TIGHTER on the deep window).
(iv) THE TRANSPORT/CEILING CHASE (G43): exact identity THETA_FG ==
theta_y * lock per rung (definitional, gated <= 1e-30); exact
transport theorems (G10, sympy): [THETA_FG <= THETA_MAX and lock >=
L] ==> theta_y <= THETA_MAX/L, and [theta_y <= t and lock <= L']
==> THETA_FG <= t L' (the r162 theta-window and H3 are EQUIVALENT
statements on the two-sided lock manifold).  MEASURED: THETA_FG
ladder max 0.2674 (h = 7), min 0.1117; min measured lock 2.2345
(h = 28).  HONEST NUMBERS: with the MEASURED lock floor the
transported ceiling is 0.2674/2.2345 = 0.1197 < THETA_BAR = 0.155
(margin 1.295); with only the GATED window edge L = 1.0 it is
0.2674 > 0.155 -- the window-edge transport bounds theta_y but does
NOT recover the 0.155 bar.  CONSUMPTION FLAGGED: the premise
"THETA_FG flat/capped for all h" is the v926 MEASURED quartic law
(AIC p = 3.9072 +- 0.1136), NOT proven -- the ceiling statement is
typed CONDITIONAL-ON-MEASURED and is NOT counted as a delivered
theorem (G61 keeps FG-QUARTIC-MEAS out of the delivered ancestor
set).  C1 VERDICT: MECHANISM LOCATED, NOT REDUCED -- the theta_y
saturation is the r162 THETA-flatness one coordinate up, tied by
the gated two-sided lock; the lambda-uniform residue does NOT empty
into classics this round.

=======================================================================
C2 -- THE COFINAL WEAKENING (S1 G11-G13, S3c G44)
=======================================================================
(i) PIGEONHOLE IS EXACT AND FREE (G11): block-min <= block-average
(weighted, proven generic + instances): AVG-THETA(bar) per block ==>
H3-cofinal(bar).  (ii) THE DEFECT COLLAPSE (G11, the honest
surprise): for a defect-D near-monotone observable (theta(h) <=
theta(h') + D for h <= h'), H3-cofinal(bar) ==> H3-FORALL-h(bar+D):
MEASURED D = 0.004183 (drawdown h = 14 -> 19) = 2.7% of THETA_BAR:
the cofinal and forall-h statements differ by <= 0.0042 on the
measured ladder -- QUANTIFIER-GAP-MEASURED-THIN: the SEQ-cofinal
weakening buys AT MOST the measured oscillation, which is ~30x
smaller than the H3 margin.  The averaging route cannot be
materially easier than the pointwise route for this observable.
(iii) THE SUBSIDY IS EMPTY AND VANISHES WITH DEPTH (G44): dyadic
blocks B2 = [4,8), B3 = [8,16), B4 = [16,32) (B4 partial at 28+30,
DISCLOSED; half-open convention frozen here, r166 used closed
endpoints -- convention-only, no criterion moved): block min/avg =
0.7533/0.9233/0.9604 rising -> 1: the pigeonhole gain shrinks to
4% at depth.  CONTRAST (the r166 mechanism): tau block-averaging
harvested SIGNED detrended cancellation (ratio 0.461 -> 0.037,
improving with depth); theta_y terms are POSITIVE LEVELS: |sum| ==
sum identically (G12, sympy) -- AVERAGING-NOTHING-TO-CANCEL.
(iv) BA-DICTIONARY EXPRESSIBILITY (G13): BA1-BA3 bound block-tau
from BELOW via per-rung ward-class floors (zsum - OFF); an
AVG-THETA bound needs per-rung classical CEILINGS of |A_2/A_0|; the
corpus ceiling routes are enumerated and all dead: TRIANGLE
(measured vacuous 1e3.4 -> 1e64.6, r172), A0-FLOOR (== pinning-
supply LOOP {TAUPOS, TLAWCAP}, flagged), MOMENT-CAP (y_t-normalized,
circular, r172), H3 itself (the target); the r166 adjudication
NO-EXACT-CROSS-H-MECHANISM (no corpus identity sums over h) is
cited and re-affirmed for the y_t observable.  C2 VERDICT:
BLOCK-AVERAGE + PIGEONHOLE DOES NOT CARRY -- it is an exact but
subsidy-empty reformulation; its bound sits in the SAME epistemic
class as pointwise H3 (arithmetic-pinned, zero-free, source-family):
BA-INEXPRESSIBLE-FOR-YT.

=======================================================================
C3 -- THE WITNESS BOUNDARY (S1 G14-G16, S3 G36, S4 G53/G56/G57)
=======================================================================
KEY STRUCTURAL FACT (from the builder, machine-used throughout): the
source c is the GROUND-STATE EIGENVECTOR of the world matrix M --
the witness perturbs the VECTOR, not the world: M, tau, lam1,
FULLGAP are witness-INVARIANT.  Hence lock'' == lock/W EXACTLY for
any fixed-M y_t-inflation x W, and the two-sided lock window
(1.0, 8.0) refuses EVERY such witness with W > 8 in BOTH directions
(G16, exact; measured: inflation 3.6444e-3 < 1.0, deflation
3.6444e+3 > 8.0).
(a) THE BROKEN-CONSTRAINT LIST (G56, all frozen strings, h = 5):
INFLATION 2-mode (dnorm 8.117888e-2): BREAKS {G30 ground-state
certificate: r0''/tau = 3.430e13 vs bar 1e-25 (39 orders); G32 lock
3.6444e-3; G33/G34 theta 62.690999 > bar; G35 J2'' = -1.121e-6
below window, cap'' = 1.000042 below window; G37 census
complete-real BROKEN (8/10 real) and top 1.000001 > 0.95; BA3
BRIDGE: zsum''/zsum = 3.579247e8 and (tau + OFF - zsum'')/tau =
-3.4372e8 < 0}; SATISFIES {A_0 invariance <= 1e-40, sign, kappa
window (one-sided), B_1/trace identities, TR-CAP, H1 (c* exists:
H1-WORLD-BLIND replicated)}.  DEFLATION 2-mode: BREAKS {G30
(3.248e10), lock 3.6444e3 > 8, theta 6.2691e-5 < 0.03, J2 1.271e5,
kappa'' = 96.09 > 0.30, census 6/10, H1 REFUSED (domain empty),
BA3 (-3.4361e2)}; ztop_all = 24.870225 (r172 string).  THE BA3
FINDING IS NEW AND REVERSES THE PRIOR GUESS: the witness is NOT
budget-blind -- the r166/r169 bridge (mechanism-loss) refuses BOTH
witness directions exactly as it refuses the fake worlds: the
witness moves the zero-side sum by x3.6e8 while A_0 is invariant.
(b) THE ESCALATION WITNESS (G57, new): the 3-mode J2-PRESERVING
inflation (solve d_1..d_3: A_0'' = A_0, A_2'' = W A_2, A_4'' = W^2
A_4; generic sympy + mp instance): REPAIRS {J2'' == J2 exact, rho
argmax 1, cap 1.251769 in window, census 10/10 complete-real, top
0.852300 in TOP_WIN, SR1, H1 c* exists} -- the moment/census windows
are NOT the load-bearing exclusion -- but STILL BREAKS {G30: r0''/
tau = 5.600e14; lock 3.6444e-3; theta 62.691; BA3: zsum''/zsum =
8.738751e15, residual -8.3920e15}, CANNOT preserve J3 (A_6''/(W^3
A_6) = -1.08e-4 != 1, generic 3-mode obstruction, sympy), and its
PRICE EXPLODES: dnorm3 = 8.197491e3 = 1.0e5 x the 2-mode price (the
J2 repair costs a LARGE source perturbation, no longer a cheap
witness).  MANIFOLD-EXCLUSION-ESCALATION-STABLE.
(c) THE STABILITY THEOREM (G15 proven + G36 instantiated): DK
sin-theta lemma (proven generic K = 3 + rational instance): any
vector v passing the per-rung certificate {|R(v)/tau - 1| <=
RAY_BAR, ||Mv - R(v) v|| <= r} lies within sin(angle) <= r/(lam1 -
R(v)) of the census source; with Cauchy-Schwarz on the A_0/A_2
functionals this pins y_t: rel-y_t-move <= (|A_2|^{-1}||e_2|| +
|A_0|^{-1}||e_0||) dv/(1 - ||e_0|| dv/|A_0|).  MEASURED RADII: at
the frozen gate bar r = 1e-25 tau: 4.478e-25 (h4), 3.472e-23 (h5),
5.322e-17 (h8), 6.568e-6 (h13), growing with h (the 1/A_0
cancellation eats the fixed bar; the bar-level guarantee crosses
O(1) near h ~ 16: STABILITY-CROSSOVER-MEASURED, reported ladder);
at the MEASURED eigsy residuals (dps-scaled): 1.617e-50, 3.373e-43,
2.669e-43, 1.011e-47 -- H3 cannot be moved by ANY certificate-
passing source at measured precision: H3-NORM-STABLE-AT-MEASURED-
RESIDUALS.  C3 VERDICT: H3's falsifiability boundary is a THEOREM
boundary (r171 modus-tollens pattern): every y_t-moving perturbation
either leaves the ground state (G30, DK-quantified), exits the
two-sided lock window (exact, both directions), breaks the BA3
bridge (measured x3.6e8), or leaves the world (controls + size
separator): H3 restricted to the certified constraint manifold is
norm-stable; off the manifold it is refutable at exponentially
small cost (r172, restated not hidden).

NO record run existed yet).  ONE sympy INSTRUMENT bug in the exact
layer, no bar, window, tab or criterion moved anywhere: the G15 DK
positivity polynomial was parametrized with rho = lam0 + (g - w),
which leaves the cross-term -2 a0^2 g w in the expansion of
(lam0 - rho)^2 and defeats the all-coefficients-positive check even
though the inequality is true; fixed to the clean slack
parametrization g = e + w (rho = lam0 + e, lam1 - rho = w > 0),
under which the claim polynomial is a0^2 e^2 + a2^2 (2 w s2 + s2^2)
with coefficients (1, 2, 1) all positive.  Fix verified in
isolation before re-freeze; smoke2 at the fixed SHA must be clean.
