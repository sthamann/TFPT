r"""ext3_fresh_anchors_probe -- PRIME.AUDIT.EXT3_FRESH_ANCHORS.01
(round 329): THE EXT3 FRESH-ANCHOR ROUND -- audit repair 2+3 for the
sequence bias of the r321/r324 lane.

THE AUDIT FINDING (r328A/C, binding contract of this round): the SAME
65-rung class ladder has been the test set across r306..r327; the F_A
coordinate was SELECTED on that test anatomy in r317 (it ranks the
known violators on top) and CERTIFIED on the same set in r321 --
SLIDING_BOUND_GO carries less independence evidence than "0/39"
suggests (audit A2).  Audit C1 adds the CONSTRUCTION-FAMILY bias: the
kz ladder is LARGE-GAP selected (the frame-A window depth is
h ~ 4 log z / gap, so the h <= 900 core cap admits exactly the
prime-power anchors whose local log-gap is LARGE; audit C measured
the anchors at median 2.0x the local median gap in its own
convention).  THE REPAIR (audit recommendation 2, the proven r293
protocol shape): FRESH EXT3 ANCHORS at FROZEN CONSTANTS -- new
windows that appeared in NO previous round, evaluated against the
four frozen constants of the lane with NOTHING recalibrated, plus
the small-gap contrast that answers C1 quantitatively.

TWO-COMMIT FREEZE PROTOCOL (NEW -- this is the FIRST round under it,
audit repair (2) of r328A): the sealed spec (this docstring WITHOUT
the record tables) is COMMITTED to git BEFORE the record run
("experiments: r329 pre-freeze"), and the probe is committed AGAIN
after the record-table insertion ("experiments: r329 record").  The
freeze discipline (spec sealed before evaluation, record tables the
only post-freeze edit) is thereby independently verifiable from git
history for the first time -- the audit-A1 verifiability gap this
protocol closes.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO promotion, NO
ledger row, NO marker moved, NO RH CLAIM in either direction.
Coexistence: the wave-13 worker (v970) and R330/R331 run in
parallel; this probe touches NOTHING outside its own file and the
strictly additive rh-sync (existing entries byte-identical).

THE OBJECT (r269/r287/r298/r306/r314/r316/r317/r321/r324/r327
machinery imported verbatim): t_{N-2} = sum_b ct_b (r244 chain rows,
r266 eval); F = 0.20 edge split; maximal same-sign runs of the
bx-sorted bulk; level-2 blocks (r270 convention); the frozen
positional block machinery (r298); the r306 RY3.cubic_moments +
RY3.renyi3_ratio + RY3.calib_freeze; the r314 SCF.fold_genealogy +
SCF.signed_cube_terms + SCF.flux_telescope; the r316
TRB.two_regime_state + TRB.split_midladder; the r317
EFP.local_ratio; the r321 CCP.local_median + CCP.world_coord; the
r324 QMO.scale_bins + QMO.pileup_state + QMO.mult_ward; the r327
GMC.group_mass_ledger + GMC.heavy_state; the r286 LM.ext_rule
(READ-ONLY, used-set reproduction only); PDelta = Pbeta - Pomega;
x_j = (PDelta)_j.  NEW in this round (module-own, source-pure):
admissible_pool (the frame-A CONSTRUCTION with the h-cap as a
parameter -- warded EXACT against core.frame_a_zones at the frozen
cap), grel_col (the relative local prime-power gap), used_kz_set
(the exclusion ledger of every previously used window), ext3_select
(the sealed two-strata choice rule) and gap_class.

THE ANCHOR CONSTRUCTION CONVENTION (extracted from the builders,
used VERBATIM -- only the anchor CHOICE differs): an anchor is an
index kz into the prime-power list (U_ALL = log of the n with
Lambda(n) > 0, table cap 400000, zone horizon 380000); the window is
D_k = 0.5 G_ALL[kz]/NU_MAIN (G_ALL = diff(U_ALL) the local log-gap,
NU_MAIN = 4), M_k = ceil(U_ALL[kz]/D_k) + 1 rounded even, h_k =
M_k/2, admissible iff h_k >= H_MIN = 128 and >= N_ATOM_MIN = 40
atoms below e^{2 alpha}; kz scans range(2, NZ_DEEP - 2).  The
document rule additionally caps h_k <= HCAP = 1450 -- THAT cap (plus
the probe-level strata h <= 900 / 1300 / 1650 and the r286 rule's
z^2 <= 400000) is the CHOICE that produced every prior window.  The
structural consequence h ~ 4 log z / gap couples depth to gap: the
core ladder is large-gap selected BY CONSTRUCTION of its cap.

THE USED-WINDOW LEDGER (sealed exclusion rule): USED = the kz of
core.frame_a_zones() (70 windows: the 42-rung core ladder h <= 900,
the 20-member EXT pool 900 < h <= 1300 -- first 15 = the r286/r306
extension anchors, all 20 in the r321/r324 EXT2 pool -- and the 8
members 1300 < h <= 1450 of the EXT2 pool) UNION the kz of the first
35 rows of the r286 LM.ext_rule (the r286 extension ranks 0..14 +
the r307 EXT2 ranks 15..34, N_w up to 1650, z^2 <= 400000).  This
covers every window of every round r238..r328 in both lanes (the
rho/cubic lane draws from frame_a_zones; the LSTAR lane from the
r286 rule).  The collision ward demands EXT3 intersect USED == empty
EXACT (must-fail e1 proves it bites).

THE SEALED EXT3 CHOICE RULE (frozen BEFORE evaluation; source-pure:
consumes U_ALL/G_ALL/h/z + the used ledger ONLY -- no bound value,
no target, no gap-rule-after-sight; e3/e4 prove the audits bite):
  POOL  = admissible_pool(H_MIN, EXT3_H_MAX = 2600), FRESH = POOL
          minus USED.  Relative local gap grel(kz) = G_ALL[kz] /
          median{G_ALL[j] : |j - kz| <= GAP_W = 5, j != kz} (the
          r317 W-window convention applied to the gap column).
  STRATUM B (SMALL-GAP MID-ZONE, the audit-C1 contrast): FRESH kz
          whose prime power z lies INSIDE the core ladder's own zone
          range [z_min(core), z_max(core)] (computed live, expected
          16..317), sorted by (grel, kz) ASCENDING -- deliberately
          the SMALLEST relative gaps, the anti-selection of the
          large-gap ladder -- the first K_STRAT = 6 admitted.
  STRATUM A (DEPTH): the remaining FRESH kz sorted by (h, kz)
          DESCENDING (as deep as the budget carries), the first
          K_STRAT = 6 admitted.
  ADMISSION (class-ladder convention, r316/r321 verbatim):
          POSITIVE_PREFIX (nf is None) and fold multiplicity <=
          MULT_CAP = 2; a failing candidate is REPLACED by the next
          one in the stratum's sealed order (census disclosed).
  Both strata are expected deeper than every prior window (N_w >
  1650) -- in this construction a small relative gap FORCES depth
  (h ~ 4 log z / gap): the mid-zone stratum is "mid" in ANCHOR
  POSITION (same prime-power zone as the ladder), not in window
  depth; this is the honest geometry of the audit-C repair and is
  said out loud rather than hidden.

THE FOUR FROZEN TESTS (NOTHING recalibrated; every constant is a
sealed record number of its round, applied POINTWISE to every EXT3
anchor; every violation is an honest result that calibrates the
REACH of the lane, not a drama):
  (a) r321 SLIDING BOUND:  rho_2 <= 1.3056 x F_A^2  (b FROZEN;
      rho_2 = m^2 sum q^3 / (log m)^2 the r306 scale; F_A = the
      r317 rank-local QMAX ratio computed by EFP.local_ratio on the
      EXTENDED (N, kz)-sorted class ladder = the 65 sealed rungs +
      the admitted EXT3 anchors -- the fresh rows get genuine
      rank-local neighborhoods; the r321 insertion-rule coordinate
      (CCP.world_coord vs the pure-65 columns) is printed as a
      disclosed secondary census, it does not adjudicate).
  (b) r306 BASE BOUND:     sum q^3 <= 1.069 x (log m)^2 / m^2,
      i.e. rho_2 <= 1.069 (C FROZEN, the first-5 constant).
  (c) r324 SCALE COUNT:    nsc_rel / log m <= 2.0258  (C_NSC
      FROZEN; nsc_rel = # distinct dyadic source scales s <=
      2 log2 m in the argmax block, QMO.pileup_state verbatim).
  (d) r327 GROUP COUNT:    ngl = ng(argmax block) / log m <= 2.6351
      (C_NG FROZEN; GMC.group_mass_ledger + GMC.heavy_state
      verbatim).
  (e) r324 e_tot TREND (MEASUREMENT ONLY, no gate): G/log m =
      m qmax / log m and m M_2 = m sum q^2 on the EXT3 anchors;
      dyadic halves-slopes vs m over the 12 anchors; e_tot = e_G +
      e_M2 printed against the r324 record +0.172 (= +0.158 +
      +0.014) with the a-priori census band |de| <= 0.15 typing
      EXPONENT_CONSISTENT / EXPONENT_SHIFTED -- census, not gate.

THE SMALL-GAP CONTRAST (audit C1, sealed adjudication): cohorts
  B (the 6 small-gap mid-zone anchors), A (the 6 depth anchors) and
  LADDER_DEEP (the class-ladder rungs of rank >= 42, i.e. the
  EXT/EXT2 segment N_w 942..~1600 -- the large-gap-selected
  reference in the overlapping depth regime).  Metrics per cohort:
  med rho_2, med F_A (one consistent column: the extended-ladder
  F_A), spike rate = fraction with F_A >= SPIKE_FA = 1.5, med
  G/log m, med m M_2.  SEALED RULE (coarse a-priori bars, symmetric):
  SMALL_GAP_DIFFERENT iff  med rho_2(B)/med rho_2(LADDER_DEEP)
  >= 2 or <= 1/2,  OR  |spike(B) - spike(LADDER_DEEP)| >= 0.5,  OR
  med F_A(B)/med F_A(LADDER_DEEP) >= 1.5 or <= 2/3; else
  SMALL_GAP_SIMILAR.  The firing clause(s) are named in the letter.

LEG 0 -- ANCHOR REGRESSION (slim set; every band a record number
adopted as-is, disclosed): r263 branch rule (35 cheap + the named 7
exceptions); r306 C_2 = 1.069 (tol 0.005) first-5 freeze with 0/57;
r316 class ladder n = 65 + rho anchors kz53/kz67/kz55/kz83 =
1.0490/1.0536/0.4821/0.7790 (tol 0.005) + C_small 1.0694 at kz18;
r321 b = (max cal B)^2 = 1.3056 (tol 0.005) with 0/39 test
violations + named 4/4; r324 C_NSC = 2.0258 (tol 0.005) with 0/39;
r327 C_NG = 2.6351 (tol 0.005) with 0/39 + named 4/4; the r314
identity wards live everywhere.

LEG A -- SEAL + PURITY + TOYS + LIVE WARDS: (A1) the sealed
definitions printed; the SOURCE-PURE selection table (stratum, kz,
z, h, N, grel, gap class) printed BEFORE any bound-side value of
this round.  (A2) SOURCE-PURITY AUDITS: the AST identifier scan over
admissible_pool + grel_col + used_kz_set + ext3_select + gap_class
must be clean against BOUND_FORBIDDEN + PHI3_FORBIDDEN; the literal
scan over the same five builders must be clean against the sealed
record-literal set R329_TABLE_LITERALS; e2/e3/e4 prove the audits
bite.  (A3) TOY EXACTNESS: the grel spike toy ((1,1,1,5,1,1,1) ->
grel = (1,1,1,5,1,1,1) EXACT); the gap_class toys (0.5 -> SMALL,
1.0 -> MED, 2.0 -> LARGE); the ext3_select toy (synthetic 6-window
pool with a 2-member used set -> strata EXACT, collision ward
empty); the collision toy (injected used anchor -> intersection
non-empty EXACT); the halves-slope toy (m = (2, 4), v = (1, 2) ->
slope exactly 1).  (A4) LIVE WARDS on every live world: the r316
chain + NORM x cube == rho_2 (r321 verbatim); the r324
interpolation M_3 <= qmax M_2 <= qmax^2; the pileup chain m qmax <=
nsc x pil + exact scale recomposition; the r327 ledger == genealogy
identity + group partition + L1 recomposition; the extended-ladder
reconstruction QMAX == F_A x medloc EXACT; frame-A REPRODUCTION:
admissible_pool(H_MIN, HCAP) == core.frame_a_zones() EXACT (the
construction is verbatim, not a sibling) and h(kz) == the
PIK.build_rung h on every selected anchor EXACT.

LEG E -- WARDS / MUST-FAILS (>= 4 mutants + 2 scope mutants):
(e1) ANCHOR COLLISION WITH THE LADDER: mutant_collision injects a
  core-ladder kz into the fresh set -- the disjointness ward must
  CATCH the non-empty intersection EXACT while the real selection
  is disjoint EXACT.
(e2) CONSTANT RECALIBRATION SIMULATED: mutant_b_recal recalibrates
  the sliding constant on the fresh anchors (consumes the evaluated
  bound column) -- the BOUND_FORBIDDEN scope audit must FLAG it AND
  on the sealed toy it returns 1.0 != the frozen 1.3056 (diff
  >= MUT_MIN) -- CAUGHT twice.  The real tests consume the FROZEN
  record numbers only.
(e3) GAP RULE AFTER SIGHT: mutant_gap_posthoc re-picks the gap
  threshold to minimize the seen violations (consumes the bound
  column) -- the scope audit must FLAG it AND on the sealed toy it
  returns a threshold != the sealed stratification's -- CAUGHT.
(e4) TARGET READ-BACK IN THE SELECTION: mutant_strat_readback
  consumes the cubic-moment record (cm/S3) as a 'selection score'
  -- the PHI3_FORBIDDEN scan must FLAG it (AST-CAUGHT) while the
  five module-own selection builders stay clean.
(m5a/m5b) WORLD-BLINDNESS BREAK: a builder consuming the withheld
  terminal drive key and a builder consuming the branch label are
  both FLAGGED by the AST scope audit.

INDEX FIREWALL (binding, r238-r328 discipline): w = window (kz into
the prime-power list), N_w = builder depth, k/n = chain degree;
ground truth (branch labels, the true R/t/Z values) enters GATES and
census tables only; the cubic target rho_2 / S_3 enters GATES /
anchors / the frozen-test tables only, NEVER a selection builder
(AST-warded); no zero/prime oracles anywhere (AST firewall; the
prime-power ANCHOR GRID U_ALL/G_ALL is the sealed source comb of the
whole campaign, r238 convention -- anchor selection on the source
grid is not an oracle read); no fit primitives (fragment audit; the
exponents are the imported r272 dyadic halves-slope, fit-free).

DISCLOSED PRE-SPEC INPUT (sizing only, r306 precedent -- no rho, no
S_3, no F_A, no qmax, no bound value of ANY window was computed
before this spec froze): one scoping pass enumerated the pools and
counted candidates (frame-A 70 = 42 + 20 + 8; lifted pool h <= 2600
has 124 windows; FRESH = 44 after the used-ledger exclusion, of
which only 2 have h <= 1650 -- the frame-A pool is EXHAUSTED below
1650, so fresh anchors are necessarily deep; the core-zone
small-gap candidates exist with grel 0.28..0.53) and timed two
wpacks for the budget (N 1721: 3.4 s, N 2577: 15.1 s -- 12 anchors
feasible); the core ladder z-range 16..317 and the core-42 grel
median 1.34 (this module's own W = 5 log-gap convention; the audit's
2.0x was measured in the audit's own convention -- both are
reported, neither is tuned); EXT3_H_MAX = 2600, K_STRAT = 6, the
gap-class edges, SPIKE_FA and every contrast bar are a-priori
choices sized BEFORE any evaluation; the four frozen constants and
the e_tot reference are sealed RECORD numbers of r321/r306/r324/
r327, adopted as-is; the verdict letters are symmetric -- every
outcome maps to exactly one letter by CONTRACT.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';
exactly one of the two main letters fires):
  R329_ANCHORS(branch rule, r306 C_2 + 0/57, r316 n/rho/C_small,
    r321 b + 0/39 + named, r324 C_NSC + 0/39, r327 C_NG + 0/39 +
    named, identity wards)
+ SEAL(construction reproduction + used ledger + selection freeze +
    purity audits + toys + live wards)
+ SELECTION(12 anchors, strata, gap statistics vs the ladder)
+ EXT3_TABLE(per anchor: the four frozen tests + reserves)
+ [exactly one of] EXT3_ALL_HOLD(min reserves per constant) /
    EXT3_VIOLATIONS(which constant, which anchors, gap class)
+ ETOT(e_G/e_M2/e_tot vs the r324 record, census tag)
+ GAPCONTRAST(cohort metrics + SMALL_GAP_DIFFERENT(clauses) /
    SMALL_GAP_SIMILAR)
+ MUSTFAIL_LEDGER(e1-e4 + scopes).
Honesty before beauty: the selection rule, the used ledger, the
strata, the frozen constants, the census bands and the contrast
bars are sealed BEFORE any window of this round is evaluated; the
constants are FROZEN record numbers -- nothing is recalibrated, and
a violation is an honest reach-calibration of the lane, not a
failure of this round; the 12 anchors are FRESH by machine-checked
disjointness, but they are NOT an independent world -- they come
from the same source comb and the same construction (only the
choice differs), and the small-gap stratum is necessarily DEEP (the
construction couples gap to depth): the round buys INDEPENDENCE OF
THE ANCHOR CHOICE, not a second world; the e_tot numbers on 12
anchors are census-grade (two dyadic halves of 6); r243-r328 stand.
