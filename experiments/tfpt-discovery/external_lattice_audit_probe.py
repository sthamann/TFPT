"""Discovery probe: the external-review lattice audit -- three claimed
derivations machine-checked: the FOUR-MARK CLOSURE (d = 4 forced three
ways under the D_{d+1} + A_{d-1} glue architecture), the ANCHOR BYTECODE
(one cubic polynomial and a two-state recursion carry the discrete
source code), and the LORENTZ CONGRUENCE (the prime-front determinant
form and the cover polarization lattice are the SAME rational quadratic
form, index 6).  Honest negative included: the review's follow-up B-test
is ill-posed as stated.

An external review (2026-08-02) proposed three new derivations plus an
RH proof architecture.  Per the audit workflow, every checkable claim is
machine-verified before adoption:

  (A) THE FOUR-MARK CLOSURE [E, conditional]: generalize the glue to
      D_{d+1} + A_{d-1}.  Three INDEPENDENT selectors each force d = 4:
      (A1) disc-group matching: disc(A_{d-1}) = Z_d is cyclic; a
      cyclic-x-cyclic glue needs disc(D_{d+1}) cyclic, i.e. d even, and
      Z_d = Z_4 forces d = 4 (census d = 3, 4, 5, 8 with negative
      controls);
      (A2) the even-glue norm equation (d+1)/4 + (d-1)/d = 2 has the
      UNIQUE positive solution d = 4, and no other even value 2k
      (k <= 10) admits an integer solution;
      (A3) the Pythagorean selector (d-1)^2 + d^2 = (d+1)^2 holds for
      positive d exactly at d = 4 -- the (3, 4, 5) triple of (cycles,
      marks, carrier) is the unique Pythagorean closure.
      Consequences: (1,1,2) is the UNIQUE 3-part partition of 4, and
      c_3 = 1/(2 e_1 pi) = 1/(8 pi): under the named architecture the
      two-input presentation reduces to ONE boundary degree d = 4
      (plus pi).  Honest typing: conditional on the glue architecture
      (genus-0 boundary, A-side cycles, D-side functions, cyclic even
      unimodular glue); the d = 4 special case (5/4 + 3/4 = 2) was
      already exact in the corpus (v47-era selection).

  (B) THE ANCHOR BYTECODE [E, consolidation]: chi_a(t) = (t-1)^2(t-2)
      = t^3 - 4t^2 + 5t - 2 carries (e_1, e_2, e_3) = (4, 5, 2) =
      (marks, carrier, sheet involution); the power sums p_n = 2 + 2^n
      satisfy the two-state recursion p_{n+2} = 3 p_{n+1} - 2 p_n
      (p_0 = 3, p_1 = 4); Newton identities recover the e_k; and
      p_1 p_2 p_3 = 240, p_4 - p_3 = 8, 240 + 8 = 248 = dim E_8.
      The operator realization H = 1 + V(V-1)/2 with char chi_a is
      already machine-checked (v602) -- this packages the discrete
      source as: d = 4 -> chi(t) -> recursion -> E_8.

  (C) THE LORENTZ CONGRUENCE [E + honest negative]:
      (C1) det X = (1/2) y^T J_det y with y = (X11, X22, X12) and
      J_det = [[0,1,0],[1,0,0],[0,0,-2]] (the prime-front determinant
      form; det 2, signature (1,2));
      (C2) THE CONGRUENCE: P = [[3,0,0],[3,0,2],[-1,1,-1]] with
      det P = -6 satisfies P^T J_det P = J_fix EXACTLY (J_fix the v604
      integer polarization form, det 72): the two Lorentz lattices are
      the SAME rational quadratic form, the cover an index-6 sublattice;
      72/2 = 36 = 6^2 and 6 = p_2(a) (the A_3 positive-root count);
      (C3) [X, must-fail honest] the review's follow-up test
      "integer R with R^T J_det R = B, |det R| = 2" is ILL-POSED as
      stated: B = M^dagger J (v602) is COMPLEX symmetric (det 8
      verified) -- no real congruence can produce it;
      (C4) [E, partial positive] on the reformulated field level the
      third symmetric-Gauss diagonal ratio IS an exact Q(omega) square
      ((1 - sqrt3 i)^2 = -2 - 2 sqrt3 i); the full Q(omega)-congruence
      (Hasse invariants) and the CANONICITY of P (derivation from the
      cover operators) are the named open steps.
