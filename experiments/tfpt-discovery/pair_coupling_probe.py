r"""pair_coupling_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.PAIR_COUPLING.01 (round 343):
the DRESSED PAIR RESERVE r'_det -- the O(1) certificate candidate of
r342 -- put under fire: exact anatomy of the Schur dressing, the
honest refutation attempt on fresh families, the adjudication of the
analytic lower-bound question, and the second Schur clause
lambda_rest < 1 with its peeling structure.

R342 (pair_extremal_probe, SPEC_SHA b09f8ccd, PAIR_LAW_FOUND +
PAIR_WORLD_COMPLETE) established: L* at the binding point is the
determinant condition c^2 < pq of the shallow-edge two-atom block;
the EXACT Schur decomposition L* <=> {lambda_max(D) < 1} AND
{lambda_max(A + C (I-D)^{-1} C^T) < 1} (logdet-gated); the rest
margin 1 - lambda_rest decays parallel to the full margin (slope
-3.276, offset ~20x) while the DRESSED reserve r'_det = 1 -
c'^2/(p'q') is FLAT (slope +0.018, w9 value 0.303) -- the first
flat, positive, source-near O(1) quantity of the L* lane.  THE
ROUND'S CONTRACT (the r342-R343 kill, sharpened): does r'_det
possess an ANALYTIC O(1) lower bound from the source -- or does its
flatness break on a fresh family?

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO promotion,
NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO RH CLAIM in either direction.
Coexistence: R341 (Bellman, terminal) may run in parallel -- this
probe touches NOTHING outside its own file and the strictly
additive rh-sync.  Two-commit freeze protocol (r329 convention):
spec + machinery committed BEFORE the record run, record tables
inserted after.

THE EXACT OBJECTS (all gated): per rung the r342 bundle (d1, d2, c,
p, q, r_det, m2, margin, pair mass, PR, det/interlacing/Schur-logdet
identities) via the IMPORTED r342 build verbatim; the dressed block
A' = A + C (I-D)^{-1} C^T with (d1', d2', c'), p' = 1-d1', q' =
1-d2', r'_det = 1 - c'^2/(p'q'), m2' = 1 - lambda_max(A'); THE
RESOLVENT-CORRELATION IDENTITY (this round's exact spine): I - A'
is the inverse of the 2x2 pair block M of (I-E)^{-1}, hence
    r'_det = 1 - M_12^2 / (M_11 M_22)
-- the dressed reserve IS the Cauchy-Schwarz reserve of the
resolvent (I-E)^{-1} at the pair (gated per rung against the
independent full-inverse route); THE SPECTRAL EXPANSION (exact,
gated): with (delta_m, w_m) the eigenpairs of the rest block D and
alpha_m = u_1 . w_m, beta_m = u_2 . w_m (u_k = the coupling rows
E[pair_k, rest]),
    Delta d_1 = sum_m alpha_m^2 / (1 - delta_m)   (d_2: beta_m),
    Delta c   = sum_m alpha_m beta_m / (1 - delta_m),
    d_k' = d_k + Delta d_k,  c' = c + Delta c
-- the exact decomposition r'_det = f(bare scalars, rest coupling
vectors) demanded by the contract, printed per rung with its
absorption anatomy (Delta d_1/p, Delta c/c, top-mode shares); the
TOP-K RESOLVENT SHADOW r'_K = the same correlation reserve with
(I-E)^{-1} truncated to its top K eigenmodes (K = S_- reproduces
r'_det exactly -- the toy gate); the BARE LAMBDA SHADOW r_shadow =
margin (p + q - margin)/(pq) (what r'_det would be if the dressing
carried NO content beyond lambda_max and the bare scalars -- the
sealed RESTATEMENT test); the GAP RATIO g21 = (1-lambda_2)/
(1-lambda_1) (the reduced O(1) coordinate of the top-2 reading);
the CERTIFIED-BOUND RELAXATION LADDER (Leg C, measured): R1 exact
(== r'_det), R2 sign relaxation |c'| <= |c| + |Delta c|, R3
per-mode Cauchy-Schwarz |Delta c| <= sum |alpha_m beta_m|/(1 -
delta_m), R4 the K-split operator-tail bound (top-K modes exact,
tail by ||tail||^2/(1 - delta_{K+1})) -- each level a THEOREM-GRADE
inequality chain whose INPUTS are measured scalars; r'_lb(K)
printed for K in {0, 1, 3, 8, 32}; THE PEELING COORDINATES (Leg D):
the rest block's own top eigenvector (PR, mass on the rest
shallow-edge pair, folds) and the level-2 Schur dressing of that
pair inside D (lambda_rest2, r''_det) -- the recursion question,
plus the full level-k cascade census on w9.

INDEX FIREWALL (binding, r238-r342 discipline): w = window (kz into
the prime-power list), S = #union atoms, S_- = #nu atoms, N_w =
(S+1)//2; ground truth (r283/r284/r286/r329/r334/r342 records,
control flips, kappa_int records) enters GATES and record tables
only; the module-own constructors consume kernel Gram / spectrum /
weight / position arrays ONLY (AST scope audit; the spectrum of the
INSTRUMENTED matrix is the round's object of study -- the withheld
identifiers are the RECORD values and the verdict-side fit results);
no zero/prime oracles anywhere (AST firewall; the prime-power grid
is the sealed source comb, r238 convention); no fit primitives

LEG 0 -- ANCHORS BIT-NEAR (r342 record numbers as gates): w9 pair
(d1 0.970014, d2 0.964904, c 0.032252, r_det 1.1561e-2, m2
1.8749e-4), w9 Schur (lambda_rest 0.996338, dressed 0.999154 /
0.998710 / 0.000872, r'_det 0.3029), the kz130 s3 row, the R2
cohort medians 0.205/0.188/0.437/0.557, kz56 R2 1.836, the EXT3
margin minimum 4.20e-9 at kz127, the r342 fit slopes (p -0.754, q
-0.645, c -0.697, m2 -3.341, margin -3.332, restm -3.276, rdetp
+0.018 -- the DISCLOSED PRIORS of this round), the digamma
dictionary on the sample rungs (DIGAMMA_BAR 0.02, V_BAR 0.10), the
r334/r342 kappa_int records (EPST 1793.99, SCR 8.51e6, SMOOTH
2.193, HL2 1964, MAIN/TWIN 0.999567).

LEG A -- THE ANATOMY OF THE DRESSING: per rung the exact
decomposition columns (Delta d_1/p, Delta d_2/q, Delta c/c, bare
correlation rho = c/sqrt(pq), dressed rho' = c'/sqrt(p'q'), m2'/
margin, g21, top-1/top-3 mode shares of Delta d_1); the mechanism
said with numbers: the bare cancellation rho -> 1 (r_det ~ N^-2.6)
is ABSORBED by a signed cancellation Delta c ~ -c in the dressing
while p, q are eaten proportionally -- the dressed correlation
rho' stays bounded; source-explicitness census: the coupling-row
profile share of ||u_1||^2 on arch-rim rest atoms (u < log 2) and
the dictionary prediction of the REST-pair weights (the peeling
pair) on the sample rungs -- the weight side of the dressing is
dictionary-explicit, the kernel side stays census-grade (r342
negative #4, restated honestly).

LEG B -- THE HONEST KILL (sealed fit rules BEFORE the record):
Theil-Sen fit of log r'_det vs log N_w on the 57 (42 core + 15
r286 extension); FLAT_57 iff |slope| <= FLAT_BAR = 0.15 AND
|halves curvature| <= CURV_BAR = 0.35.  PURE TEST on the 12 r329
EXT3 anchors (their per-row r'_det/lambda_rest columns were NEVER
printed in r342 -- genuinely blind rows): in-band iff |log10(pred/
meas)| <= 0.5 with pred from the 57-fit; need >= 10/12; EXT3
low-side count n_low (meas below the lower band edge).  EXT4 (the
fresh-family stress, sealed selection below): same band, low-side
count.  DECAYS iff (slope_57 <= -0.30 with |curv| <= 0.35) OR
(EXT3 n_low >= 4) OR (EXT4 n_low >= 3) OR (any arbitrated
positive-margin row has r'_det <= RDETP_FLOOR = 0.01) OR (FLAT
fails on any clause -- soft decay, clauses named).  FLAT survives
iff FLAT_57 AND EXT3 in-band >= 10/12 AND EXT4 n_low <= 1.  The
decision tree is exhaustive; the kill direction is the default.

LEG C -- THE LOWER-BOUND ADJUDICATION: the relaxation ladder
R1-R4 evaluated on every rung (detailed print on the sample);
sealed census statistic: n_pos(K) = #rows with r'_lb(K) > 0 for
K in {0, 1, 3, 8, 32}; the O1-certificate clause (sealed,
symmetric): DRESSED_RESERVE_O1_CERTIFIED requires FLAT + r'_lb(K
<= 32) >= DELTA_BAR = 0.05 on ALL arbitrated rows + KERNEL_CLOSED_
FORM (a closed-form source derivation of the coupling norms and
lambda_rest -- sealed FALSE this round: the kernel side has no
closed form, r342 negative #4).  Honest typing: every inequality
in R2-R4 is theorem-grade (triangle, Cauchy-Schwarz, operator
norm); the INPUTS are measured; and the s1 scoping already shows
the sign relaxation R2 is CATASTROPHIC at w9 (the dressing works
by the signed cancellation Delta c ~ -c, so |c| + |Delta c| ~ 2|c|
overshoots the cancelled c' by ~70x and r'_R2 = -3708) -- the
reachable positive outcome of this round is FLAT_CENSUS, and the
concretized specialist question is typed: an O(1) bound must
control the SIGNED cancellation, equivalently the gap ratio g21
and the top-2 eigenvector geometry at the pair (the top-2 shadow
census below).

LEG D -- THE SECOND CLAUSE + PEELING: lambda_rest per rung (fit
vs the -3.276 prior, offset ratio (1-lambda_rest)/margin); world
column: does lambda_rest alone separate the dead worlds?; the
rest-top-eigenvector census (PR, rest-shallow-pair mass, folds)
on all rungs; level-2 dressing (lambda_rest2, r''_det) on all
rungs; the w9 level-k cascade (k = 1..6).  PEELING_STRUCTURE_FOUND
(additive tag) iff median rest-pair mass on the 57 >= 0.90 AND min
r''_det on the 57 >= PEEL_R2_FLOOR = 0.05 -- the induction
candidate (L* as pair peeling), typed, never claimed.

LEG E -- WORLDS + MUST-FAILS: MAIN / TWIN / EPST / SCR / SMOOTH /
HL2 (r278/r280 channel verbatim, minC == flips 25/21/27/25 gated)
at their OWN N_w: lambda_max, lambda_rest, dressed reserve (UNDEF
iff lambda_rest >= 1), pair mass, PR, kappa_int (r334 machinery
verbatim, records gated); the EXACT SCHUR EQUIVALENCE GATE per
world: (lambda_max < 1) == (lambda_rest < 1 AND p' > 0 AND q' > 0
AND r'_det > 0).  MUST-FAILS (>= 5, each loud): (m1) DRESSING AT
THE WRONG BLOCK: the two largest-v atoms as 'pair' -- CAUGHT by
the concentration check (top-eigenvector mass < 0.5); (m2) r'_det
READ BACK from the withheld lambda record -- AST-FLAGGED; (m3)
FLATNESS BAR RE-PICKED AFTER SIGHT: a mutant consuming the
withheld fit slope -- AST-FLAGGED, and on the sealed toy returns
!= the sealed FLAT_BAR (protocol-CAUGHT: the bars are frozen
module constants under the two-commit protocol); (m4) SCHUR
IDENTITY WITH SWAPPED BLOCKS: det(I-E) claimed == det(I-A') x
det(I-D'') with BOTH blocks dressed (double-counted coupling) --
breaks the exact logdet identity by >= 1.0 log-units on w9; (m5)
RESOLVENT CORRELATION READ OFF E INSTEAD OF (I-E)^{-1} -- breaks
by >= 0.1 rel on w9.  STOP LIST (anti-gates, binding): NO L*
claim, NO bound mechanism promoted, NO certificate reading of the
census bound, NO posthoc bar / band / family / prior move, NO
derived 5/7, NO RH claim; r243..r342 stand.

THE SEALED EXT4 SELECTION (fresh-family stress, source-pure,
r329 machinery verbatim): USED = E3.used_kz_set(core.frame_a_
zones(), LM.ext_rule(), 35) UNION the 12 r329/r342 EXT3 anchors
(gated == 92); POOL = E3.admissible_pool(H_MIN, EXT4_H_MAX =
3400); DOMAIN: z^2 <= 400000 (= the family's von Mangoldt TABLE
CAP: a window with z^2 beyond the table has a TRUNCATED source
comb and is NOT an instance of the documented family -- the s2
scoping fact: the h-desc queue head kz277 (z 1583) builds a
truncated non-instance with margin -228; the cap is a family-
definition fact, not a posthoc filter); FRESH = POOL minus USED
under the domain (gated == 23); STRATUM B4 = the 3 smallest-grel
fresh kz with z inside the core zone range [16, 317] (grel =
E3.grel_col, r317 W = 5 convention); STRATUM A4 = the 3 deepest
(h desc) of the remainder.  Selection gated == the s3-disclosed
queues B4 (72, 75, 66) / A4 (113, 111, 108), N_w in [2656, 3181]
exact -- ALL deeper than the 57 (max 1218) and interleaving the
EXT3 range.  Grid identity gate: int(V.PP[kz]) == int(core._NN
[kz]) on all 18 EXT3+EXT4 anchors.  CONTINGENCY (sealed): any f64
margin <= 0 on a fresh row is excluded from fits and typed; mp
arbitration only for N_w <= 2600 (budget), else typed
F64_ONLY_NEGATIVE.

PRE-SPEC SCOPING (disclosed, r342-s1..s3 precedent -- no bar,
band, threshold, family or adjudication rule was tuned after any
evaluation except as sized here and said so): (s1) the w9
extension was probed end-to-end: resolvent identity dev 8.9e-14;
m2'/margin 1.0029 (the dressed pair margin IS the full margin to
0.3 percent); top-K shadows 0.0 / 0.2883 / 0.2994 / 0.3015 /
0.3027 at K = 1/2/3/5/10 vs r'_det 0.3029 -- the dressed reserve
is a TOP-2-DOMINATED spectral object; Delta d_1 top-1/top-3 mode
shares 0.19/0.33 (the absorption is NOT single-mode); the
relaxation bounds r'_lb(K) = -inf at every K and the sign-only
reserve r'_R2 = -3708 (Delta c = -0.0314 vs c = +0.0323: the
dressing IS a signed near-cancellation -- the triangle route is
dead on arrival, disclosed BEFORE the freeze); bare shadow ratio
r_shadow/r'_det = 0.034 (the RESTATEMENT test is expected NOT to
fire; rule sealed symmetric anyway); rest-top eigenvector mass
0.9807 on the rest shallow pair folds (6, 8), lambda_rest2
0.973300, r''_det 0.5502 (the peeling signal exists at w9).
(s2) the EXT4 enumeration: without the domain cap the h-desc
queue head is kz277 (z 1583, z^2 = 2.5e6 > TABLE_CAP) -- a
truncated-comb NON-instance (margin -228, lambda_rest 229); the
domain-capped fresh pool has 23 windows.  (s3) the six EXT4 rows
were probed end-to-end for budget and bar sizing (2.5 s each;
margins +3.0e-9..+1.6e-8 all positive; r'_det 0.2368..0.3679;
m2'/margin 1.000..1.031; rest-pair mass 0.944..0.9997; r''_det
0.51..0.73; resolvent-route devs <= 1.1e-8, spectral devs <=
2e-13 -- sizing RES_ROUTE_BAR/SPECTRAL_BAR) -- DISCLOSED
HONESTLY: all six EXT4 rows were seen before the freeze; the
blind teeth of the flatness adjudication are the 12 EXT3 rows
(per-row r'_det / lambda_rest never printed in r342) plus the
sealed fit protocol; the sealed adjudication rules were fixed
BEFORE any EXT3 dressed column was seen.

Honesty before beauty: r'_det flat on 69 + 6 windows is a MEASURED
census, never an asymptotic theorem; the resolvent-correlation
identity and the R2-R4 inequality chains are exact finite-matrix
facts (theorem-grade SKELETON) whose inputs are measured window
scalars (census-grade FLESH); the sign autopsy shows WHY no
triangle-route certificate can work -- the honest content of Leg C
is the typed specialist question, not a bound; a passing world
clause is a measured discriminator on six instrumented worlds;
the peeling tag is an induction CANDIDATE, not an induction; no
verdict claims L*, a bound mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH
progress in any direction.

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
