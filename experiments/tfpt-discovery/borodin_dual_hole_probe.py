r"""borodin_dual_hole_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.DUAL_HOLE.01
(round 356): THE BORODIN PARTICLE-HOLE DUALITY WITH RECIPROCAL
WEIGHT -- the ONE approved internal L* round after the idea search
(DCCIV: two independent thinkers, Sol rank 1), plus the AC-CLASS
FALSIFIER (Fable's leg 0) as the co-deliverable.  After this round
the L* lane returns to the specialist memo.

THE FROZEN QUESTION (r352/r354): the L* margin is a 500x
cancellation of two co-wandering blocks (phi_D = log pq + A lnN
and phi_K = log c^2 + A lnN, corr 0.999998, 0.88 nats each vs
0.0017 nats difference); the r354 four-block anatomy ended in a
TWO-BLOCK INTERFERENCE (pair geometry P2/PG corr +0.887 at 2.4x
amplitude vs dictionary weights W corr -0.722) with NO single
carrier at the sealed bars.  THE ROUND'S CONTRACT (Sol's sketch,
binding): lift (mu, nu) to the POSITIVE total measure eta = mu +
nu with u_j = |wtilde_j| on the union support X; let Pi_N^u be the
rank-N projection kernel of the eta OP ensemble and Q =
(Pi_N^u)_{Y,Y} on Y = supp nu.  Then EXACTLY (the L-ensemble
transformation): Q = E (I+E)^{-1} and E = Q (I-Q)^{-1}.  With the
Borodin dual weight u_vee_j = 1/(u_j P_X'(x_j)^2) (P_X the monic
node polynomial of the FULL support X) and the rank condition S =
2N - 1 (HALF FILLING -- the r228/r281 law re-consumed as Borodin's
complementary rank condition), Borodin's complementation gives
Pi_N^u = D (I - Pi_{N-1}^{u_vee}) D with the diagonal sign matrix
D_jj = sign P_X'(x_j) = (-1)^{f_j}; hence with R =
(Pi_{N-1}^{u_vee})_{Y,Y}:
    E = D (R^{-1} - I) D,    I - E = D (2I - R^{-1}) D,
    L*  <=>  lambda_max(E) < 1  <=>  R > (1/2) I,
    margin == 2 - 1/lambda_min(R)   (exact spectral map),
    c == eps_1 eps_2 (R^{-1})_{12},  p == 2 - (R^{-1})_{11},
i.e. the r342 pair block is (up to D-signs) the (1,2) principal
minor of 2I - R^{-1}: the 500x cancellation read as the two-point
PRECISION structure of a dual HOLE process at half filling.  ON
THE COSINE LATTICE (the document support IS the full folded grid
x_j = cos(pi j / S), j = 1..S, S = L/2 = M - 1): P_X(x) =
2^{1-S} (x+1) U_{S-1}(x), |P_X'(x_j)| = 2^{1-S} S kappa_j /
(1 - x_j) with kappa_j = 1 (j < S), 2 (j = S), and with the
document weight u_j = (1/S) c_j (1 - x_j) |f(theta_j)| (c_S = 1/2,
the folding endpoint halving) the dual weight becomes exactly
    u_vee_j  PROPTO  c_j (1 - x_j) / |f(theta_j)|
-- the ORIGINAL weight carries +log|f|, the DUAL weight -log|f|:
the measured r354 anti-correlation of the weight block against the
pair-geometry block is ALGEBRAIC BY DESIGN under the duality
(gated below).  Equivalently, symbol-free: u_vee_j PROPTO
(1 - x_j)^2 / (u_j kappa_j^2) (route B; the construction route).

THE FIVE LEGS: (Leg A) THE EXACT ALGEBRA, gated: (a1) the
rank/support gate on the REAL windows -- S == L/2 == 2 N_w - 1
(no culled fold atoms), the union support == the full cosine grid
BITWISE, the weight identity u == (1/S) c_j (1-x) |f| against the
INDEPENDENTLY recomputed circulant symbol f (V.prime_lags +
V.arch_lags + V.spectral_density, document route) -- any real-
window failure => SUPPORT_GATE_FAIL typing with the honest census
how far the duality still carries; (a2) Q = E(I+E)^{-1} exact:
Fractions on a 5-atom rational model (both the L-ensemble
transformation and the roundtrip E = Q(I-Q)^{-1}), f64 <= 1e-10 on
w9 and graded on every ladder row; (a3) the dual weight built
THREE ways -- route A (numeric log |P_X'| pairwise sums, grid-
agnostic), route B ((1-x)^2/(u kappa^2), the grid closed form),
route C (c_j (1-x)/|f| with the recomputed symbol) -- A == B up to
the mean (graded bars), B == C bitwise-tight (the weight
dictionary identity), plus the exact-Fractions Borodin
complementation Pi_N^u + G Pi_{N-1}^{u_vee} G^{-1} == I with the
RATIONAL conjugator G = diag(1/(u_j P_X'(x_j))) (no square roots
-- the sign matrix and the weight ratio combine rationally);
(a4) the full complementation, the spectral map margin ==
2 - 1/lambda_min(R), the pair identities c == eps1 eps2
(R^{-1})_{12}, p/q == 2 - (R^{-1})_{kk}, and the dual block
factorization log c^2 == DW + DK + GC with
    DW = log(u_vee_1 u_vee_2)          [reciprocal dictionary],
    DK = 2 log |Kvee_{12}|             [dual CD block],
    GC = 2 log |(R^{-1})_{12} / R_{12}| [global conditioning],
(DW + DK = 2 log |R_12|) -- all graded on the 85-row ladder.
(Leg B) THE CARRIER TEST, sealed: the fine-structure operator
psi57 (Theil-Sen line fitted on the 57 OLD rows ONLY, residual
evaluated everywhere, median-centred on the 57 -- EXT3..EXT6 stay
PURETEST) applied to the target log c^2, the THREE dual blocks
(DW, DK, GC) and the r354 four-block family (W, B2, P2, GM, PG --
recomputed in-run on identical rows for the apples-to-apples
census); a dual block CARRIES iff corr >= CAR_CORR_MIN 0.9 AND
leave-out <= CAR_RES_MAX 0.5 on the 57 (the r354 sealed clauses
reused); THE COMPRESSION CLAUSE: the carrier additionally needs
leave-out(best dual) <= COMPRESS_FACTOR 0.5 x leave-out(best r354
block, in-run) -- honesty: the SUM block DW + DK = log c^2 - GC is
near-tautological (GC is small) and is EXCLUDED from the sealed
list, printed as census with the tautology named; THE RESERVE
CLAUSE: the LOCAL dual two-point block ((R_pair)^{-1} of the 2x2
restriction -- consumes R_11, R_12, R_22 ONLY, never p/q/c: the
readback is the m6 must-fail) predicts the log reserve LR =
-log(c^2/pq) via LR_loc = -log(c_loc^2/(p_loc q_loc)); clauses
corr(psi57 LR_loc, psi57 LR) >= RES_CORR_MIN 0.9 AND leave-out <=
RES_RES_MAX 0.5 on the 57, EXT puretest census.  (Leg A-anti) THE
BY-DESIGN GATE: corr(psi57 DW, psi57 W) <= ANTI_BAR -0.99 on the
57 -- the r354 anti-correlation pattern as duality algebra
(DW == 2 log((1-y1)(1-y2)) - W + const, the geometry factor is
family-constant by the hard-edge scaling); corr(psi57 DK, psi57
PG) printed as census.  (Leg C) WORLDS + TWIN: the dual pipeline
on the r354 mini-ladders (WORLD_KZ, 6 rungs) for MAIN + rational
TWIN (must CARRY: MAIN slope-free local-dual coupling corr >=
FS_CORR_MIN 0.99 / rmsr <= FS_RMSR_MAX 0.2; TWIN dose-zero
BITWISE and pointwise dual devs <= TWIN_DUAL_BAR 1e-3 nats) and
the ladderable dead worlds SMOOTH / SCR / DIR / ABS (r354 channel
verbatim; EPST / HL2 NOT_LADDERED, kz9-specific, typed): a dead
world LOSES iff it fails the mini carrier clause OR the mini
reserve clause on its usable rows (sealed usable-row rules:
finite logs, pq > 0, c^2 > 0 for the carrier; additionally LR > 0
and LR_loc > 0 finite for the reserve; < WORLD_MIN_ROWS 5 usable
=> NOT_MEASURABLE census); if the main carrier AND reserve
clauses fire AND some measurable dead world passes BOTH mini
clauses => WORLD_BLIND; the lambda_min(R) world census is printed
(the duality equivalence makes R > I/2 fail structurally exactly
on the dead worlds -- the L* condition restated, census not
clause).  (Leg D) THE DEMARCATION GATE against r227/r228 (read
verbatim from the DLIII/DLIV records): the r228 object was the
SIGNED measure mutilde = mu - nu (Hankel-determinant
complementation D_{N-m}(mutilde) = Vand^2 (prod w) D_m(mutilde#)
with dual reference weights 1/(w L_N'^2)), and its r-quotient
duality died on the ZERO-WEIGHT structure (mu == 0 on every nu
node: R_DUAL_OBSTRUCTED) -- HERE the lift is the POSITIVE measure
eta = mu + nu with u = |wtilde| > 0 on EVERY union node, so the
Borodin dual weight EXISTS everywhere (gated: min u > 0 and
u_vee finite on all rows); the r228 half-filling law N_w =
ceil(S/2) (NOT_A_HOLE_EDGE) is CONSUMED here as the exact
complementary rank condition S = 2N - 1; the r228
COMPLEMENT_IDENTITY_EXACT tool survives as the determinant shadow
of the projection-kernel complementation used here; the
DUAL_WALL_EQUIVALENT risk is typed by the verdict enum itself
(DUALITY_REPARAM_ONLY exists for exactly this).  (Leg E) THE AC
FALSIFIER (co-deliverable, cheap): the rescaled pair positions
a_k = 2 N^2 (1 - y_k) are FAMILY-CONSTANT against pi^2 f_k^2 / 4
(the hard-edge microscopic scaling; ward |a/(pi^2 f^2/4) - 1| <=
AC_POS_FACT 3 / N_w per row, fold census printed), and the
Lubinsky-type AC universality prediction rho_K -> const (fixed
rescaled positions => a fixed Bessel-kernel ratio) CONTRADICTS
the measured decorrelation a_rhoK = 1.4222 (r352 record, re-gated
at tol 0.05 on the 57): AC_CLASS_EXCLUDED fires iff the position
ward passes AND a_rhoK >= AC_DECAY_MIN 0.5 -- the universality-
class exclusion typed for the memo; deep rhoK band census
(EXT5/EXT6 vs the 57-fit) printed.

PRE-SPEC SCOPING (disclosed, r343-s1..r354-s1 precedent -- no
bar, band, threshold, block list, clause or adjudication rule was
tuned after any evaluation except as sized here and said so):
(s1) FOUR sample rungs (kz9, kz44, kz56, kz130) were probed
end-to-end for machinery and bar sizing: support gate S == L/2 ==
2 N_w - 1 with grid dev 0.0 and weight-identity dev 0.0 BITWISE
on all four; Q = E(I+E)^{-1} devs 1.6e-13 .. 1.5e-12; dual-route
A/B devs 2.0e-12 .. 1.3e-10; Y-complementation devs 3.1e-13 ..
2.0e-11; full-X complementation 3.7e-13 at w9; margin_dual abs
devs 4.5e-13 .. 4.2e-11; c/p/q identity rel devs 1.1e-11 ..
7.6e-9; block identities 2.1e-11 .. 2.8e-9; lambda_min(R)
0.500041882 -> 0.500000001 (the L* condition AS R > I/2, live);
the dual blocks (DW, DK, GC) and LR_loc sized as the anchors
above; the m2 rank mutant breaks by 6.1e-3 .. 5.9e-4 (bar sized
at w9), the m5 mutant by ~0.61 == 1 - e^{-GC/2}; runtime 2.9 s
for the four rungs.  (s2) the world channel (MAIN / TWIN /
SMOOTH / SCR / DIR / ABS at kz44 + kz9, machinery only, NO
adjudication): every world satisfies the support gate on the
SAME grid (the folding is world-independent), the dual identity
holds at 1e-12 .. 1e-13 everywhere, and lambda_min(R) separates
structurally (MAIN/TWIN 0.5000+, SMOOTH 0.311/0.476, SCR/DIR ~0,
ABS 4e-6 .. 3e-5) -- the sizing observation behind the census-
not-clause typing of the lambda_min(R) world column.  (s3) EXT6
timing at kz133 (S 15883, N_w 7942, S_- 4566): the full dual
block costs ~15 s (P' loop 0.8 s, chains ~1.5 s, solves/eighs
~12 s), margin 3.848e-10 vs margin_dual -1.154e-10 -- THE F64
RESOLUTION TRUTH at EXT6 depth (complementation dev 5.3e-10,
sized into MDUAL_BAR deep and disclosed in the verdict); deep
pair identities dev_c 1.5e-7 / dev_p 4.4e-7 (sized into CID_BAR
deep 1e-4), block identity 3.0e-7 (BLKID_BAR deep 1e-4), kz133
blocks (DW -25.3706, DK +13.6376, GC +1.4881), LR_loc/LR ratio
0.71, folds (2, 4).  No ladder-wide fit, carrier, reserve,
feature or world adjudication was evaluated before this spec
froze; the numbers cited above are published record numbers or
the disclosed scoping values, never sealed-fit previews.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';
precedence TARGET_LEAK > SUPPORT_GATE_FAIL > the carrier
adjudication -- the enum is exhaustive):
  [exactly one of]
  TARGET_LEAK(loci)  iff any firewall/scope/fragment audit fails /
  SUPPORT_GATE_FAIL(rows)  iff the rank/support gate fails on any
    real ladder window (the duality carry census printed) /
  DUAL_HOLE_CARRIER_GO(block, compression, reserve, worlds)  iff
    the exact algebra gates all pass AND a sealed dual block
    carries (corr >= 0.9, leave-out <= 0.5 on the 57) AND the
    compression clause fires (best dual leave-out <= 0.5 x best
    r354-block leave-out in-run) AND the reserve clauses fire
    AND the world separation holds (MAIN + TWIN carry, no
    measurable dead world passes both mini clauses) /
  DUALITY_REPARAM_ONLY(failing clauses)  otherwise -- the duality
    is EXACT but does not compress the one-object problem: the
    lane is FINAL at the specialist memo, said honestly
  + WORLD_BLIND(worlds)  [only if the main carrier AND reserve
    clauses fire and a measurable dead world passes both]
  + [exactly one of] AC_CLASS_EXCLUDED(a_rhoK, position ward) /
    AC_CENSUS(values)  [always -- Fable's falsifier co-verdict]
  + DEMARCATION_LEDGER(r228 contrast: positive lift vs signed
    Hankel, dual weight exists on all nodes, half-filling law
    consumed as rank condition) [always]
  + DUAL_MARGIN_LEDGER(lambda_min(R) census incl. the EXT6 f64
    sign-resolution truth) [always]
  + WORLD_LEDGER + TWIN_LEDGER + MUSTFAIL_LEDGER [always].
Honesty before beauty: the complementation, the spectral map and
the pair identities are exact finite-matrix facts (theorem-grade
SKELETON) whose inputs are measured window scalars (census-grade
FLESH); a passing carrier block at the sealed bars is a
LOCALIZATION, not a mechanism; the duality itself CANNOT create
information -- DUALITY_REPARAM_ONLY is the honest null and it
sends the lane to the memo; the anti-correlation gate shows the
r354 interference pattern is duality algebra, not new physics;
AC_CLASS_EXCLUDED is a universality-class STATEMENT FOR THE MEMO,
never a wall mechanism; no verdict claims L*, a bound mechanism,
a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any direction.

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
