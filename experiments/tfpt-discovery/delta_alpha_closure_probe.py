r"""delta_alpha_closure_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.DELTA_ALPHA_CLOSURE.01
(round 347): THE ONE-LINE IDENTITY -- does the margin exponent
follow from the cancellation law?  The named successor round of
r345: the exact 2x2 determinant identity of the DRESSED pair block
is put in charge of the exponent bookkeeping, and the question
delta = 2.67 vs alpha = 3.33 is adjudicated as an ACCOUNTING
statement with every building block typed (theorem-grade /
certified-census / fit-census).

THE CHAIN (r342/r343/r345, all sealed records): r342 established
the two-atom law at the binding point (bare decay laws p -0.754 /
q -0.645 / c -0.697; margin exponent alpha = 3.332 on the 57 with
the composition a_p + a_q + rho_r - a_(p+q) closing to 0.007 and
rho_r = 2.624 OPEN); r343 the exact resolvent dressing (m2'/margin
in [1.0003, 1.031] -- the dressed 2x2 IS the lambda_max carrier;
the dressing works by the signed cancellation Delta c ~ -c); r345
the curvature-honest certificate on BOTH flat coordinates (r'_det,
g21; 0/75 band outliers) and THE CANCELLATION LAW c'/c ~
N_w^-2.668 (halves-stable, EXT3 10/12 high-side, EXT4 6/6;
bookkeeping slope(c') - slope(c) = -2.703 vs -2.668).  THE TYPED
ONE-LINE QUESTION (this round's contract): with the EXACT identity
    m2' (p' + q' - m2') = p' q' - c'^2 = p' q' r'_det
(2x2 algebra of the dressed block, both eigenvalue deficits are
the roots of t^2 - (p'+q') t + (p'q' - c'^2)) and the measured
near-identity m2' == margin (the r343 bridge), the margin exponent
is a SLOPE COMBINATION of dressed columns; and since r'_det is
certified flat and c'^2 = (1 - r'_det) p' q' EXACTLY, the chain
collapses -- if the dressed aspect ratios are flat -- to the ONE
LINE
    alpha == a_c + delta
(the margin exponent = the bare coupling exponent PLUS the
cancellation exponent).  The round seals the fits BEFORE the
record, closes the accounting at the bar |residual| <= 0.1, and
types every building block honestly.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO promotion,
NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO L* CLAIM, NO RH CLAIM in either
direction, mincut unchanged.  Coexistence: R346 (cover
canonization, terminal lane) may run in parallel -- this probe
touches NOTHING outside its own file and the strictly additive
rh-sync.  Two-commit freeze protocol (r329 convention): spec +
machinery committed BEFORE the record run, record tables inserted
after.

THE EXACT OBJECTS (all gated): per rung the r342 bundle
(PX.build_rung verbatim, SPEC_SHA prefix gated b09f8ccd) already
carries the dressed scalars (d1', d2', c') = the Schur block
A + C (I-D)^{-1} C^T, hence p' = 1 - d1', q' = 1 - d2', r'_det =
1 - c'^2/(p'q'), m2' = 1 - lambda_max(2x2'); THE ONE-LINE IDENTITY
(this round's exact spine, gated per rung): the two deficits
1 - lambda_+' and 1 - lambda_-' of the dressed 2x2 are the roots
of t^2 - s t + (p'q' - c'^2) with s = p' + q', hence EXACTLY
    m2' (s - m2') = p' q' - c'^2 = p' q' r'_det,
verified in exact Fractions on the 3x3 hand toy (the rational
product form det(I - A') == p'q' - c'^2) and per rung in f64 at
the backward-error scale (residual / (p'q' + c'^2) <= 1e-8; the
deficit m2' itself carries a 1 - lambda cancellation, sized in
scoping at <= 3.0e-10); the definitional ward c'^2 ==
(1 - r'_det) p' q' at 1e-12; THE BRIDGE (r343, now protocol-
graded): the ratio column m2'/margin over ALL 75 arbitrated rows
with the sealed clause max |m2'/margin - 1| <= 0.10 AND Theil-Sen
|slope| <= 0.15 -- the dressed second determinant IS the margin;
THE EXPONENT ACCOUNTING (Leg B): sealed Theil-Sen fits on the 57
for the dressed columns p', q', c', m2', s' = p'+q'-m2', the
bridge ratio, |c'/c| (delta), p'/p and q'/q (the dressed
dictionary factors), each with halves curvature and EXT3/EXT4
band counts from the 57-fit; THE FOUR CLOSURES (each bar 0.1):
  C1 (identity route)  alpha_meas == alpha_id = -(s_p' + s_q' +
     s_r' - s_s' - s_bridge)  [the fitted-slope image of the
     exact identity + the bridge],
  C2 (margin bridge)   slope(margin) == slope(m2'),
  C3 (cancellation bookkeeping)  slope(c') == slope(c) +
     slope(c'/c)  [the r345 census -3.401 vs -3.365,
     re-adjudicated with sealed fits],
  C4 (THE ONE LINE)    alpha_meas == a_c + delta = -slope(c) -
     slope(c'/c)  [uses NO dressed diagonal column: the margin
     exponent reduced to the bare coupling law + the cancellation
     law + flatness certificates];
THE SUPPORT CLAUSES: CURV_FLAT(r'_det) re-gated under the r345
protocol verbatim (GR.curvflat_protocol, SPEC_SHA prefix gated
1f99235a); the AUX band clauses (the aspect columns p'/q' and
s'/c' inside 0.5 decades of their 57-median on >= 73 of 75 rows,
no row beyond 0.75 -- the flat-aspect step that turns C1 into
C4); the delta-law re-gate (r345 clauses on |c'/c|: |curv| <=
0.35, EXT3 >= 10/12 in the 0.5-decade band, EXT4 n_low <= 1,
delta >= 0.5); the c-law re-gate (r342 clauses: |curv| <= 0.35,
EXT3 >= 10/12).

LEG C -- THE DRESSED DICTIONARIES: the factor columns f_p = p'/p
and f_q = q'/q (the dressing eats Delta d/p -> 1.000, r343),
adjudicated BOTH ways sealed: (i) DRESSED_DICTIONARY_GO iff both
pass the full r345 curvature-honest FLAT protocol -- p', q' would
then inherit the r342 dictionary slopes unchanged; (ii) else
DRESSED_RESIDUAL_LAW iff both pass the decay-law clauses (|curv|
<= 0.35, EXT3 >= 10/12, EXT4 n_low <= 1, delta_x >= 0.5) -- the
dressed diagonals then inherit the bare dictionary slopes MINUS a
residual cancellation exponent, with the universality census
|delta_p - delta| and |delta_q - delta| printed; (iii) else
DRESSED_FACTOR_CENSUS.  Source side re-gated (r342 route
verbatim): digamma dictionary at the pair folds <= 0.02 and
v_pred <= 0.10 on the six sample rungs -- the WEIGHT side of the
bare scalars stays closed-form, the kernel side census-grade
(r342 negative #4, never upgraded).

LEG D -- THE MIRROR WORLD CLAUSE (the r345 by-catch, sealed):
per world the rest block D at the pair, lambda_rest, and the
finite-order mirror rho_32 = -(sum_{k<=32} u_1^T D^k u_2)/c
(GR.mirror_profile verbatim).  SEALED RULE: mirror EXISTS iff
lambda_rest < 1 (the path series converges); LIVE-side iff it
exists AND |rho_32 - 1| <= MIRROR_LIVE_BAR = 0.5; DEAD-side iff
lambda_rest >= 1 (the finite-order series explodes; |rho_32|
printed, NONFINITE disclosed).  Evaluated on MAIN / TWIN / EPST /
SCR / SMOOTH / HL2 (r278/r280 channel verbatim, flips gated) AND
on the r330 second worlds DIRICHLET / DIRICHLET_ABS
(DSW.dirichlet_comb / dirichlet_abs_comb verbatim, SPEC_SHA
prefix gated 66526018, through the SAME MS/BL/FC channel) -- the
first structural test of the cancellation on a second living
arithmetic; honesty: the r330 record already SPLIT the
half-filling wall on these variants, and the w9 scoping (s1,
disclosed below) already shows both land dead-side in the E-Gram
frame (DIR lambda_rest 3.97e37, ABS 2.28e5) -- the sealed clause
TYPES this, it does not force a living-world reading;
MIRROR_WORLD_CLAUSE_SEALED iff the rule separates live 2/2 from
dead 4/4 with the Dirichlet columns typed by the same rule.

-- breaks the exact identity by >= 0.1 rel at w9 (the deficit
enters the second factor SIGNED) and loudly on the hand toy;
exactly CAUGHT.  (m2) THE CLOSURE BAR RE-PICKED AFTER SIGHT: a
mutant consuming the withheld measured residual -- AST-FLAGGED,
and on the sealed toy returns != CLOSURE_BAR (protocol-CAUGHT:
the bars are frozen module constants under the two-commit
protocol).  (m3) ALPHA READ CIRCULARLY off the margin column
instead of the identity slopes: a mutant consuming the withheld
margin column -- AST-FLAGGED; the real alpha_id constructor
consumes fitted dressed-column slopes only (scope-audited).
(m4) THE DICTIONARY FACTOR READ BACK from the withheld lambda

SIGHT of the world rho column -- AST-FLAGGED, and on the sealed

NO L* claim, NO bound mechanism promoted, NO certificate reading
of any census, NO posthoc bar / band / family / prior move, NO

PRE-SPEC SCOPING (disclosed, r343-s1/r345-s1 precedent -- no bar,
band, threshold, family or adjudication rule was tuned after any
evaluation except as sized here and said so): (s1) FOUR sample
rungs (kz9, kz44, kz56, kz130 -- all four already printed in the
r342/r343/r345 records) were probed end-to-end for machinery and
bar sizing: the one-line identity residual (backward-error scale)
spans 1.5e-14 (w9) .. 3.0e-10 (kz56) -- sizing ID_BAR 1e-8; the
definitional ward c'^2 == (1-r')p'q' <= 1.1e-16 -- RDEF_BAR
1e-12; bridges m2'/margin 1.0029 / 1.0081 / 1.0049 / 1.0180 --
sizing BRIDGE_DEV_BAR 0.10 (the r343 record says [1.0003, 1.031]
on every scoped row incl. EXT4); aspects p'/q' 0.343..0.656 and
s/c' 2.45..2.80 (both far inside the 0.5-decade AUX band); the
naive two-point slopes w9 -> kz130 (p' -4.05, q' -3.81, c'
-3.94, m2' -3.95, margin -3.95; p'/p -3.46, q'/q -3.34, c'/c
-3.41) -- steeper than the 57-fits will be (the r286 deep-family
curvature), they size NOTHING except the expectation that the
dressed-factor columns are NOT flat (the GO clause of Leg C is
expected NOT to fire; the clause is sealed symmetric anyway);
(s2) the DIR/ABS worlds were built ONCE at w9 through the
MS/BL/FC channel for construction sanity: both construct (S_-
124 / 106) and both land DEAD-side (DIR lambda 5.70e37,
lambda_rest 3.97e37, rho_32 NONFINITE; ABS lambda 2.28e5,
lambda_rest 2.28e5, rho_32 -3.8e176) -- DISCLOSED HONESTLY: the
w9 Dirichlet dead-side result was seen before the freeze; the
sealed mirror rule types it, the six standard worlds and the
whole ladder-side adjudication carry the blind weight.  Runtime
scoping 1.6 s for the four rungs + two worlds; the full run is
sized comfortably under the 1800 s bar.  No ladder-wide fit,
median, protocol clause or closure was evaluated before this
spec froze; the slopes cited above are published record numbers
or the disclosed two-point scoping values, never sealed-fit
previews.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';
precedence TARGET_LEAK > ACCOUNTING_GAP > ALPHA_CLOSED >
ALPHA_CLOSED_CENSUS -- the enum is exhaustive):
  [exactly one of]
  TARGET_LEAK(loci)  iff any firewall/scope/fragment audit fails /

    bar -- the core reduction is broken, named where /

    CURV_FLAT(r'_det) re-gates AND both AUX bands hold AND the
    delta-law re-gates AND the c-law re-gates -- the margin
    exponent is REDUCED to {the bare coupling law a_c (fit-census;
    weight side closed-form), the cancellation law delta (sealed
    fit-census law), the flatness certificates (certified

Honesty before beauty: the one-line identity is an exact
finite-matrix fact (theorem-grade SKELETON) whose inputs are
measured window scalars (census-grade FLESH); the closures are
consistency statements between SEALED Theil-Sen fits on 57 finite
windows, never asymptotic theorems; a_c and delta remain measured
laws (fit-census with sealed honesty meters) -- the reduction
moves the open analytic remainder from rho_r = 2.624 (r342) to
the SINGLE exponent delta of the cancellation law, it does not
derive delta from the source; the flatness certificates are
sealed census protocols (r345 grade); the mirror world clause is
a measured discriminator on eight instrumented worlds; no verdict
claims L*, a bound mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH progress in
any direction.

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
