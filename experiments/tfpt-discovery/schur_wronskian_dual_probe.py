r"""schur_wronskian_dual_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.DUAL.SCHUR_WRONSKIAN.01
(round 359): THE EXACT CRITICAL SCHUR BLOCK IN THE POSITIVE DUAL
SPACE -- reviewer contract L1 (DCCX theorem-first adjudication),
the favourable pre-attempt before the RHP project (L2 waits on this
verdict).  Coexistence: R358 (T1, terminal lane) and the C1 Lean
block run in parallel -- this probe touches NOTHING outside its own
file and the strictly additive rh-sync.

THE FROZEN QUESTION (reviewer verbatim, binding): do NOT estimate
p, q, c separately and subtract (that necessarily loses the 500x
reserve) -- r_N must be analysed DIRECTLY as a single determinant /
tau object.  The right language is the positive dual space (r356,
exact): L* <=> R > (1/2) I for the Y-restriction R of the rank-
(N-1) projection kernel of the reciprocal dual weight u_vee =
c_j (1 - x) / |f|.  Let Y* be the critical fold pair (2, 4) (the
r342 shallow edge) and C the rest of Y.  The exact Schur condition:
    R - I/2 > 0  <=>  {R_CC - I/2 > 0}  AND
    {S_N := M_pair - M_{pair,C} (M_CC)^{-1} M_{C,pair} > 0},
with M := R - I/2.  THE ROUND'S TARGET: an exact formula for the
critical Schur determinant in terms of two CONSECUTIVE DUAL
ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIALS, det S_N = P_N W_N(y1, y2) with P_N > 0
explicit (norms / Christoffel numbers of the dual ensemble) and a
Casoratian / Christoffel-Darboux numerator W_N; if the sign of W_N
follows from the monotonicity of P_N_vee / P_{N-1}_vee on the first
grid interval, a discrete Sturm or Markov-Stieltjes theorem could
suffice -- L* would be attackable WITHOUT RHP asymptotics.  If that
fails, the RHP route (L2: CRITICAL_SATURATION) is not optional but
the named next step -- typed honestly.

THE EXACT IDENTITY CHAIN (the round's derivation, every link a
finite-matrix theorem, machine-gated):
  (E1 SCHUR SPLIT) det M = det M_CC det S_N and, for symmetric M
    with M_CC nonsingular: M > 0 <=> M_CC > 0 AND S_N > 0; the
    Jacobi shadow S_N = [(M^{-1})_pair]^{-1}, so det S_N =
    1 / det[(M^{-1})_pair] -- THE RESERVE AS A SINGLE MINOR OF THE
    DUAL RESOLVENT, rest block carried by construction.
  (E2 SYLVESTER MINORS) (S_N)_{kl} det M_CC = det M_{C+row k,
    C+col l} -- the Schur entries are RATIOS OF BORDERED MINORS of
    det(R - I/2): the direct reserve minor, no pair-only truncation.
  (E3 CD / CASORATIAN) the entries of R are CD kernel values of the
    dual ensemble: with phl = sqrt(u_vee) p_{N-2}, phn =
    sqrt(u_vee) p_{N-1} (the two consecutive dual orthonormal
    polynomials) and b_vee the recurrence coupling p_{N-2} ->
    p_{N-1}:  (y_i - y_j) R_{ij} = b_vee (phn_i phl_j -
    phl_i phn_j)  POINTWISE on Y (the CD identity restricted).
  (E4 IIKS DRESSING) hence [D_y, R] = b_vee (phn phl^T -
    phl phn^T) is EXACTLY rank 2, and with A := I - 2R, F :=
    A^{-1} phn, G := A^{-1} phl the resolvent inherits the
    integrable structure (the discrete IIKS commutator identity):
    (y_i - y_j)(A^{-1})_{ij} = 2 b_vee (F_i G_j - G_i F_j) -- the
    OFF-DIAGONAL OF THE DUAL RESOLVENT IS A CASORATIAN OF
    RESOLVENT-DRESSED CONSECUTIVE DUAL OPs.
  (E5 THE COUPLING FORMULA) combining E1 + E4 (adjugate of the
    2x2): the ward is the adjugate identity (S_N)_{12} ==
    2 (A^{-1})_{12} det S_N; composed with the E4 Casoratian form
    of (A^{-1})_{12} (gated at the IIKS bar) it gives, with W_N :=
    F(y2) G(y1) - G(y2) F(y1) (increasing-argument orientation):
      (S_N)_{12} (y1 - y2) = -4 b_vee det S_N W_N   and
      det S_N ; 4 [ (A^{-1})_{11} (A^{-1})_{22} -
                    (A^{-1})_{12}^2 ] = 1  (resolvent-minor form),
    i.e. the exact det S_N formula in dual-OP terms carries the
    dressed Casoratian OFF-diagonally, while the DIAGONAL dual-
    resolvent values (A^{-1})_{kk} are the non-Casoratian
    remainder -- exactly the local-parametrix data of the L2/RHP
    contract.  THE PRODUCT-FORM HYPOTHESIS det S_N = P_N W_N with
    STANDALONE explicit P_N is adjudicated against the sealed
    candidates below; its failure measure (the cross share
    (A^{-1})_{12}^2 / ((A^{-1})_{11} (A^{-1})_{22})) is the precise
    handoff object to L2.

THE LEGS: (Leg 0) anchors bit-near: the r356 records (lambda_min(R)
= 0.500041882 at w9, folds (2, 4), the dual weight three ways
inherited via the verbatim BDH.dual_weights), the r342 pair
columns, the r357 chi anchors.  (Leg A) the exact Schur block on
the 85-row ladder (42 core + 15 + EXT3/4/5/6, the r356 cohorts
verbatim): the decomposition equivalence gated on every resolvable
row, det identity graded, the BINDING THESIS measured (does S_N
carry the margin: bind := lambda_min(S_N)/(lambda_min(R) - 1/2)),
the REST CLAUSE census (lambda_min(R_CC) - 1/2: how uniformly
positive -- the reviewer's L2 clause as census).  (Leg B) the
minor / Wronskian representation: E2-E5 gated (Fractions-exact on
the rational small model, f64 graded live), then the sealed
product-form adjudication with TWO explicit candidates: PC_CHR :=
b_vee^2 / (u_vee1 u_vee2 Kv11 Kv22 (y1 - y2)^2) (dual Christoffel
data -- the reviewer's norm class) and PC_DIAG := 1 / (4 (A^{-1})_
{11} (A^{-1})_{22}) (the diagonal-parametrix form; its deviation
IS the cross share).  MUST: no lambda / margin readback (AST), the
rest block carried exactly (E2 is bordered, never pair-only).
(Leg C) the Sturm test: rho := p_{N-1}_vee / p_{N-2}_vee at the
pair (monotone census rho(y1) > rho(y2)), the zero straddle census
(sign flips of the consecutive dual OPs between y2 and y1 + the
mid-node localization at the mu fold between the pair), the
dressing-sign census sign(W_dressed) == sign(W_bare), and P_N > 0
in the sealed orientation; STURM_SIGN_CARRIER only on a
0-violation census over ALL worlds/cohorts + the named classical
theorem type (discrete Sturm zero interlacing of consecutive OPs /
Markov-Stieltjes monotonicity of p_N/p_{N-1} between zeros).
(Leg D) worlds: MAIN (85 rows) + rational TWIN (dose-zero bitwise
+ pointwise Schur devs) + the r357 matched chi mod 3 AND chi mod 4
ladders (42 rungs each through the identical dual+Schur pipeline;
the formula must hold there -- r_det med 0.247, far from
saturation: the easier test case) + the matched SCRAMBLE (r357
verbatim, seed 1) with the SEALED NAMED BREAK: the rest clause
fails (lambda_min(R_CC) - 1/2 < 0, sized -0.4962) and
lambda_min(R) - 1/2 < 0, while the ALGEBRAIC identities still hold
-- the identity chain is world-blind algebra, the POSITIVITY is
arithmetic; disclosed honestly: the pair Schur block ALONE is
scramble-blind (lambda_min(S_N) = +1.4e-2 > 0 there), so carrying
the rest block is LOAD-BEARING (the m3 lesson measured on a world).
(Leg E) must-fails (6): (m1) lambda_min(R) readback -> AST-CAUGHT;
(m2) margin readback -> AST-CAUGHT; (m3) PAIR-ONLY (rest block
omitted): det M == det M_CC det(M_pair) breaks by 4.07 nats at w9
(bar 1.0) AND exactly on the Fractions toy -> CAUGHT; (m4) WRONG
DUAL-OP INDICES (N instead of N-1): the CD ward breaks by 2.02 rel
at w9 (bar 0.5) AND exactly on the toy -> CAUGHT; (m5) W_N sign
read circularly from the withheld det S_N column -> AST-CAUGHT;
(m6) NON-CONSECUTIVE polynomials (N-1, N-3): CD ward breaks by
1.08 rel at w9 (bar 0.5) AND exactly on the toy -> CAUGHT.

PRE-SPEC SCOPING (disclosed, r343-s1..r356-s1 precedent -- ONE
sizing pass on kz9/kz44/kz56/kz130 + chi3/chi4 w9 + scramble w9,
/tmp, deleted; no bar, band, clause, candidate list or verdict
rule was tuned after any evaluation except as sized here and said
so): the identity chain verifies everywhere (det identity <=
8.5e-13, CD <= 1.5e-14, IIKS 1.6e-11 (w9) .. 4.6e-5 (kz130, eps
1.2e-9 -- the conditioning truth sized into the graded bars),
coupling <= 4.2e-9, resolvent-minor <= 3.5e-9); the BINDING THESIS
is strong (bind 1.003 / 1.008 / 1.005 / 1.018 -- the critical
Schur block carries the margin to within 2 pct); the rest clause
is NOT uniformly O(1): rest_min == 13..36 x eps (it decays
parallel, the r343 lesson in the dual); det S_N tracks margin^2
(ratio 0.74..1.63); the dressed Casoratian W_N = +2.405 (w9) ..
+337 (kz130) with sign PRESERVED under dressing on every scoped
rung; P_N = det S_N / W_N = +8.6e-9 (w9) .. +6.5e-20 (kz130) --
positive in the increasing orientation but NOT matched by the
Christoffel candidate (PC_CHR misses by ~14 orders: the honest
product-form failure), and the cross share 0.67..0.84 says the
diagonal resolvent data CANNOT be dropped; the zero-straddle
census: BOTH consecutive dual OPs flip sign between y2 and y1 on
every scoped rung (the pair straddles one zero of each, interlaced)
with rho(y1) > rho(y2) throughout; chi3/chi4 w9 pass the identical
chain (devs <= 2.3e-11) with bind 1.002/1.033; the scramble breaks
at the named rest clause (-0.4962) while the algebra holds at
2.7e-16 and the PAIR BLOCK ALONE STAYS POSITIVE (+1.4e-2) -- the
rest block is load-bearing.  The verdict letters, candidate list,
orientation convention and every bar were frozen from these
numbers BEFORE any ladder-wide, chi-ladder-wide, fit-side or
adjudication evaluation.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';
precedence TARGET_LEAK > SUPPORT_GATE_FAIL > FORMULA_CHAIN_FAIL >
{DIRECT_MINOR_FOUND / RESTATEMENT / ASYMPTOTICS_REQUIRED} -- the
enum is exhaustive):
  TARGET_LEAK(loci)  iff any firewall/scope/fragment audit fails /
  SUPPORT_GATE_FAIL(rows)  iff the rank/support gate fails on any
    real MAIN ladder window /
  FORMULA_CHAIN_FAIL(loci)  iff any exact-chain ward (toys, E1-E5
    graded, equivalence on resolvable rows, Jacobi order) fails --
    the formula itself breaks at a named link /
  DIRECT_MINOR_FOUND(candidate)  iff the chain holds AND a sealed
    explicit candidate reproduces det S_N / W_N at PROD_BAR on all
    live resolvable rungs of MAIN + chi3 + chi4 AND P_N > 0
    uniformly /
  RESTATEMENT(corr)  iff the chain holds, no candidate fires, and
    corr(psi57 log P_N, psi57 log margin) >= 0.999 on the 57 --
    the unexplained prefactor IS the margin fine structure: the
    'formula' is a margin readout, said hard /
  ASYMPTOTICS_REQUIRED(object)  iff the chain holds, no candidate
    fires and the restatement census stays off -- the exact
    formula structure stands (Schur split + bordered minors +
    dressed-Casoratian coupling), the missing standalone factor is
    the DIAGONAL dual-resolvent pair data (A^{-1})_{kk}: the
    precise L2/CRITICAL_SATURATION object, with the measured cross
    share as the handoff number
  + [exactly one of] STURM_SIGN_CARRIER(theorem type)  [only with
    DIRECT_MINOR_FOUND and a 0-violation Sturm census across all
    worlds/cohorts] / STURM_CENSUS(counts)  [always otherwise]
  + SCHUR_SPLIT_LEDGER + BINDING_LEDGER + MINOR_LEDGER +
    CASORATIAN_LEDGER + REST_LEDGER(the L2 clause census) +
    WORLD_LEDGER + TWIN_LEDGER + SCRAMBLE_BREAK(named) +
    MUSTFAIL_LEDGER [always].
Honesty before beauty: E1-E5 are exact finite-matrix facts
(theorem-grade SKELETON) whose inputs are measured window scalars
(census-grade FLESH); a verified identity chain is a
REPRESENTATION, not a bound; the binding thesis and the rest-decay
census are measurements; no verdict claims L*, a bound mechanism,
a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any direction; the STOP list
(DCCX) stands: no capacity products, no local symbol/Fejer floors,
no frame-A growth ceilings, no global g_min bounds, no worst-case
martingale products, no further Borodin coordinate changes without
an analytic theorem, no depth windows only for exponent fits.

RECORD TABLES (inserted AFTER the record run -- the only
post-freeze edit, which IS the two-commit protocol: the
sealed spec above is committed as "r359 pre-freeze" BEFORE
the first full evaluation; the record tables land here with
the record commit).

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
