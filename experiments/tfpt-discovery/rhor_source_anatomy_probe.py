r"""rhor_source_anatomy_probe -- PRIME.LSTAR.RHOR_SOURCE_ANATOMY.01
(round 352): THE RHO_R SOURCE ANATOMY -- the last census member of
the closed L* exponent chain, plus the g_K12 second-instrument
lane.  The named successor round of r350 (ALPHA_SOURCE_CLOSED at
candidate-law grade): after r350 the exponent chain alpha == a_p +
a_q + rho_r - a_(p+q) closes source-side with ONE census member,
rho_r = 2.624 -- the cancellation exponent of the BARE reserve
r_det = 1 - c^2/(pq) (r342), halves-curved -0.767, no clean power
law.  Via BK3 (a_c == (a_p + a_q)/2 at 0.002) c^2 and pq share the
LEADING exponent, so rho_r measures how fast the ratio c^2/pq
saturates to 1 -- the r338-q1 backward-Cauchy-Schwarz question in
its sharpest form: rho_r is the CORRELATION structure between the
diagonal and cross kernel values at the pair.  THE ROUND'S
QUESTION: can rho_r be reduced to the candidate laws + the g_K12
fine structure -- are the two named rests (g_K12, the one dirty
census column of r350, and rho_r, the last census member) ONE
object -- and does a second instrument carry the g_K12 law on the
deep cohorts?

THE CHAIN (r342..r350, all sealed records): r342 the two-atom law
(bare decay laws p -0.754 / q -0.645 / c -0.697; digamma/tent
weight dictionary at v_pred 9.0e-4; rho_r = 2.624 named as the
open analytic remainder, halves-curved -0.767); r343 the exact
resolvent dressing + the EXT4 selection rule (domain cap z^2 <=
400000); r345 the cancellation law + the curvature-honest flatness
protocol; r347 the one-line closure; r348 the RATE_EQUALITY
theorem + the twin slow laws y0/rho_hi; r350 the alpha source
anatomy (weights WOERTERBUCH |s_v - s_vpred| = 0.0000; deficits
CANDIDATE-LAW a_p -> [3/4, 2 x 0.38], a_q -> [2/3, 1 - 0.38],
unresolvable on 57 windows; pinning SATZ-grade Fractions-exact;
kernel profile g_K11 +1.786 / g_K22 +1.683 == reciprocal weight
laws (BK2), g_K12 +0.902 THE one dirty census column (curv +0.500,
EXT3 5/12; REL2 (g_K11 + g_K22)/4 hits at 0.035, census), a_kappa
0.711 CLEAN (hits [2/3, 3/4]); BK3 0.002; CD-recursion ward
1.2e-10 on the sealed sample; rho_r = 2.624 the single census
member).  THE ROUND'S CONTRACT: (Leg A) THE RHO_R DECOMPOSITION:
from the exact pair identities d_k = v_k K_kk, c = sqrt(v1 v2) K12
the KERNEL CORRELATION at the pair is
    rho_K = K12^2/(K11 K22) = c^2/(d1 d2)
(the weights cancel EXACTLY -- rho_K is a weight-free kernel
object), and the bare reserve obeys the EXACT identities
    (i)   c^2 == rho_K d1 d2,
    (ii)  r_det == 1 - rho_K d1 d2 / (p q),
    (iii) r_det == (1 - rho_K) + rho_K (p + q - 1)/(p q)
(exact rearrangements; verified bit-near per rung and in exact
Fractions on the r342 hand toy: d1 = 1/4, d2 = 1/2, c = 1/8 gives
rho_K = 1/8 and r_det = 23/24 on all three routes).  The sealed
adjudications: (A-decor) IS 1 - rho_K THE CARRIER? -- the round's
naming hypothesis, adjudicated symmetrically (DECOR_CARRIER iff
the fitted decay exponent of 1 - rho_K is >= 0.3 AND within 0.5
of rho_r; the s1 scoping shows 1 - rho_K = 0.9989 -> 0.99994:
the kernel DEcorrelates (rho_K -> 0), it does not saturate --
the expected reading is a CLEAN REFUTATION, the r348
CARRIES_DELTA motif); (A-lead) THE LEADING CANCELLATION: the
product columns c^2 and pq are fitted DIRECTLY (compose-then-fit,
the r350-a2 instrument class) and |s_csq - s_pq| <= 0.05 -- the
leading exponents cancel EXACTLY-NEAR (the BK3 image), hence
rho_r is NOT composable from the leading candidate laws: it is a
SECOND-ORDER object; (A-fine) THE ONE-OBJECT TEST: the
fine-structure columns phi_D = log(pq) + A_LEAD ln N and phi_K =
log(c^2) + A_LEAD ln N (A_LEAD = 3/4 + 2/3 = 17/12, the sealed
first-hit candidates -- the SAME leading law subtracted from
both, so phi_D - phi_K == -log s == LR EXACTLY with s = c^2/(pq)
the saturation), both demeaned: sealed clauses corr(phi_D, phi_K)
>= FS_CORR_MIN 0.99 AND rms(phi_D - phi_K)/max(rms phi) <=
FS_RMSR_MAX 0.2 -- if they fire, the deficit fine structure and
the kernel fine structure are ONE SHARED WANDER and rho_r is
exactly the decay of their difference: the two named rests are
ONE object; (A-LR) the log-reserve column LR = -log s == log(pq)
- log(rho_K d1 d2) gets the sealed decay instrument
(|s_LR - s_rdet| <= 0.05 -- the weight-free normalization carries
the SAME law; its curvature printed: if it stays curved, the
honest reading is that no clean power law appears even in the
kernel normalization).  (Leg B) THE G_K12 SECOND INSTRUMENT:
(B-i) the CD-recursion route (r350 cd_kernel_route verbatim) is
run on ALL cohorts incl. EXT4 + EXT5 (not only the 6-rung r350
sample): graded wards (1e-6 on the re-gated r350 sample, 1e-5 for
N_w <= 3200, 1e-3 on EXT5 -- sized from the observed depth trend
1.7e-13 .. 1.2e-10, one-plus decades headroom), and the K12 law
is REFIT from the CD columns: |s_K12cd - s_K12| <= 1e-6 => the
r350 dirtiness (curv +0.500, EXT3 5/12) is a STRUCTURE effect,
not a measurement/route effect; (B-ii) the REL2-equivalent flat
column CONSTRUCTED EXPLICITLY: Q = K12/(K11 K22)^(1/4) -- its
log-flatness is EXACTLY equivalent to REL2 (slope(Q) = g_K12 -
(g_K11 + g_K22)/4); adjudicated under the r345 curvature-honest
protocol verbatim (GR.curvflat_protocol) over all arbitrated rows
incl. EXT5 (the s1 scoping shows Q spans 6.6 .. 45.6 over the
four sample rungs -- ~0.84 decades: the honest expectation is
that REL2 FAILS the flatness protocol, the r350 dirty-clause
reading restated in the flat frame); (B-iii) THE EXPLANATION
LANE: pointwise EXACTLY K12 = c / sqrt(v1 v2), so with the r342
dictionary weights (vpred) the dirty column factorizes as K12 ==
[the c law, curv +0.308 CLEAN] / sqrt[dictionary weights,
closed-form curved]: sealed clauses GK12_EXPLAINED iff (e1) the
pointwise dictionary reconstruction max_k |K12 sqrt(vp1 vp2)/c -
1| <= RECON_BAR 1e-2 (r350 BK1/a1 verbatim; scoped 5.5e-4), (e2)
the c column decay clauses are CLEAN (|curv| <= 0.35, EXT3 >=
10/12, EXT4 n_low <= 1), (e3) the kappa column re-gates CLEAN
(r350 verbatim) -- then g_K12's dirtiness is INHERITED from the
closed-form dictionary weight curvature (the curvature
bookkeeping curv(K12) vs curv(c) - (curv(vp1) + curv(vp2))/2
printed as census, Theil-Sen non-additivity disclosed), and
together with rho_K = kappa^2 the one dirty column is EXPLAINED
as the quotient/composition of clean laws -- said with numbers,
never upgraded beyond the sealed clauses.  (Leg C) THE CANDIDATE
RESOLUTION on the deep cohorts: the EXT5 TRANCHE -- the r343
selection rule verbatim (E3.admissible_pool + domain cap z^2 <=
400000, used ledger extended by EXT3 + EXT4) with the h window
RAISED to (3400, 6000]: the s2 scoping census finds 9 fresh
windows, the 6 deepest by (h, kz) descending are kz (69, 107,
101, 99, 115, 89) with h (5690, 5668, 5242, 5073, 4243, 4237)
and N_w == h (window shapes are public source geometry; the
WINDOWS themselves are never measured before the record run:
genuinely blind pure-test rows, N_w up to 5690 = 1.8x the EXT4
record depth); EXT5 rows get the REDUCED bundle (bare pair +
kernel columns + CD ward + dictionary weights; the resolvent/
pinning extension is NOT computed on EXT5 -- budget honesty,
said so); sealed separation instrument per ambiguity pair
(SEP_P (3/4, 0.76), SEP_Q (2/3, 1 - 0.38 = 0.62), SEP_D0 (0.38,
2/5)): candidate lines through the 57-fit pivot, deep-cohort
residuals (EXT3 + EXT4 + EXT5 for p/q; EXT3 + EXT4 for y0),
CANDIDATES_RESOLVED(x) iff >= 5/6 of the deep rows are closer to
one candidate AND the line gap at the deep median >= 2 x the
deep residual MAD; else UNRESOLVED with the REQUIRED depth
printed (ln N* = ln N_piv + 2 w_res ln 10 / |dA - dB|) -- honest:
if the ladder is too short, the needed depth is the deliverable.
(Leg D) THE TOTAL BALANCE: the r342/r350 composition re-gated
(|alpha_comp - alpha_meas| <= 0.1) and the fully decomposed chain
printed with every member typed (dictionary / candidate-law /
theorem-grade pinning / the one second-order object); the
irreducible-rest adjudication: if the one-object clauses fire,
the rest of the lane is EXACTLY the r338-q1 specialist question
(one object, all exponents measured, all identities exact --
the specialist package FINAL); else RHOR_IRREDUCIBLE with the
full profile.  (Leg E) worlds + twin: rho_K / 1 - rho_K / s /
r_det evaluated on the 8 instrumented worlds (the r350 world
channel verbatim; on dead worlds the pair block crosses 1 --
what the DECORRELATION does there is census, printed), the
lambda_rest separation + kappa_int records re-gated, the
rational twin ward on the new columns; must-fails >= 5.

EXPLORATION ONLY (2026-08-27).  experiments/ level: NO promotion,
NO ledger row, NO marker moved, NO L* CLAIM, NO RH CLAIM in
either direction, mincut unchanged.  Coexistence: R351 (growth
law, terminal lane) may run in parallel -- this probe touches
NOTHING outside its own file and the strictly additive rh-sync.
Two-commit freeze protocol (r329 convention): spec + machinery
committed BEFORE the record run, record tables inserted after.

THE EXACT OBJECTS (all gated): per rung the r342 bundle
(PX.build_rung verbatim, SPEC_SHA prefix gated b09f8ccd), the
r343 extension (PC3.extend_rung, 9ffc2705), the r347 closure
(DA.closure_cols, bd1aa7f3), the r348 extras (DSA.rung_extras,
307814e9), the r350 kernel columns (ASA.rung_kernel_extras +
ASA.kernel_cols + ASA.cd_kernel_route, c3998c87), the r329 pool
machinery (E3.admissible_pool + used_kz_set, bbfaf199); THE NEW
COLUMNS (this round's spine): rho_K = c^2/(d1 d2) (== kappa^2
pointwise -- the Theil-Sen fit is EXACTLY homogeneous, so s_rhoK
== 2 s_kappa at 1e-9: an exact instrument gate), the saturation
s = c^2/(pq) = 1 - r_det, the log reserve LR = -log s, the
decorrelation 1 - rho_K, the REL2 column Q = K12/(K11 K22)^(1/4),
the dictionary-normalized cross kernel K12 sqrt(vp1 vp2) == c
(recon <= 1e-2), the CD-route kernel columns on every row, the
fine-structure pair (phi_D, phi_K); THE SEPARATION INSTRUMENT
(module-own, sealed): candidate lines through the 57-fit pivot,
closer-counts, gap-vs-MAD, required-depth formula.

INDEX FIREWALL (binding, r238-r350 discipline): w = window (kz
into the prime-power list), S = #union atoms, S_- = #nu atoms,
N_w = (S+1)//2; ground truth (r283..r350 records, control flips,
kappa_int records) enters GATES and record tables only; the
module-own constructors consume kernel Gram / spectrum / weight /
position / chain-coefficient arrays and measured columns ONLY
(AST scope audit; withheld identifiers are the RECORD values
ALPHA_REC and RHOR_REC and the verdict-side columns
slope_col_true, resid_spread_true, gram_k12_true); no zero/prime
oracles anywhere (AST firewall; the prime-power grid is the
sealed source comb, r238 convention); no fit primitives (fragment
audit; fits are the imported r286 Theil-Sen; the flat protocol is
the imported r345 curvflat_protocol; the decay instrument is the

LEG E -- MUST-FAILS (>= 5, each loud): (m1) THE WRONG
CORRELATION NORMALIZATION: rho_K computed against the DEFICITS
(c^2/(pq)) instead of the diagonals (c^2/(d1 d2)) -- breaks the
exact identity (ii) by >= 0.1 rel at w9 (scoped: factor ~878 off)

measured slope column and returning the nearest twelfth --
AST-FLAGGED, and the toy value is in NO sealed list.  (m3) THE
SEPARATION BAR AFTER SIGHT: a mutant re-picking the gap bar from
the withheld deep residual spread -- AST-FLAGGED, and the toy
value differs from the sealed SEP_GAP_FACTOR.  (m4) THE SECOND
INSTRUMENT READ BACK FROM THE FIRST: a mutant 'CD route'
returning the withheld Gram value -- AST-FLAGGED; plus the loud
half: the CD endpoint formula WITHOUT the b_{N-1} prefactor
breaks the kernel ward by >= 0.1 rel at w9 (r350 m1 verbatim);
exactly CAUGHT.  (m5) THE REL2 COLUMN WITH THE WRONG POWER:
K12/(K11 K22)^(1/2) instead of ^(1/4) -- on the planted flat toy
the wrong power breaks the flatness by |(g1 + g2)/4| = 0.85 >=

PRE-SPEC SCOPING (disclosed, r343-s1..r350-s1 precedent -- no

(s1) FOUR sample rungs (kz9, kz44, kz56, kz130 -- all four

the reserve); Q = 16.0225 / 6.5991 / 45.6367 / 16.8488 (~0.84
decades spread over four rungs -- the flatness expectation for
REL2 is honest-negative); the dictionary reconstruction
K12 sqrt(vp1 vp2)/c = 1.000552 / 1.000003 / 1.000000 / 1.000000;
CD-route devs 1.6e-13 / 5.2e-13 / 1.8e-11 / 1.2e-10 (sizing the
graded CD bars); runtime 2.4 s for the four rungs.  (s2) the
EXT5 pool census (selection machinery only, NO window measured):
the r343 rule at h caps 3400/4200/6000 gives 17/20/26 fresh
domain-capped windows; used ledger 92 + 6 EXT4 = 98; fresh in
(3400, 6000] = 9; the 6 deepest are kz (69, 107, 101, 99, 115,
89) with h (5690, 5668, 5242, 5073, 4243, 4237); their window
SHAPES (public source geometry, V.window_shape) give N_w == h,
z (256, 461, 431, 419, 509, 359), all z^2 <= 400000; budget
sized from the N_w^2-ish rung cost (kz130 1.5 s at N_w 2577 ->
~25-40 s at N_w 5690 with the reduced bundle).  (s3) the
Fractions toy was solved by hand: d1 = 1/4, d2 = 1/2, c = 1/8
=> rho_K = 1/8, r_det = 23/24 on routes (ii) and (iii), and the
m1 mutant value 71/72 differs by 2/69 rel -- the toy gates are
exact-value gates.  No ladder-wide fit, median, protocol clause,
candidate adjudication, separation or law was evaluated before
this spec froze; the slopes cited above are published record
numbers or the disclosed scoping values, never sealed-fit
previews.

SEALED VERDICT FORM (frozen BEFORE evaluation, joined with '+';
precedence TARGET_LEAK > RHOR_REDUCED > RHOR_IRREDUCIBLE -- the
enum is exhaustive):
  [exactly one of]
  TARGET_LEAK(loci)  iff any firewall/scope/fragment audit fails /
  RHOR_REDUCED(one-object grade)  iff the identities (i)-(iii)
    gate AND the leading cancellation |s_csq - s_pq| <= 0.05 AND
    the one-object clauses fire (corr >= 0.99, rmsr <= 0.2) AND
    |s_LR - s_rdet| <= 0.05 -- rho_r is EXACTLY the decay of the
    difference of the two fine-structure columns, which are ONE
    shared wander: the deficit rest and the kernel rest are ONE
    object, and the composition alpha == cand_p + cand_q + rho_r
    - a_(p+q) carries this single object as its only census
    member; honesty: this is a REDUCTION AND IDENTIFICATION, not
    a source derivation of 2.624 -- the exponent itself stays
    measured /
  RHOR_IRREDUCIBLE(steckbrief)  otherwise -- the reserve resists
    the decomposition; the final specialist profile printed
  + [exactly one of] RHOK_LAW_FOUND(a_kap hits, a_rhoK = 2 a_kap,
    ambiguity printed) / RHOK_CENSUS(loci)  [always -- fires iff
    the kappa clauses re-gate CLEAN AND a sealed candidate hits
    (CAND_KAP at 0.05; the squared column inherits the law with
    doubled exponent and doubled curvature, disclosed)]
  + [exactly one of] DECOR_REFUTED(slope printed) /
    DECOR_CARRIER(law)  [always -- the round's naming hypothesis
    adjudicated symmetrically]
  + [exactly one of] GK12_EXPLAINED(e1 + e2 + e3) /
    GK12_CENSUS(failed clauses)  [always -- with the REL2
    protocol result and the second-instrument (CD) verdict
    printed inside either branch]
  + [exactly one of] CANDIDATES_RESOLVED(loci) /
    CANDIDATES_UNRESOLVED(required depths printed)  [always]
  + EXT5_LEDGER(selection gate, N_w, margins, band counts,
    contingencies) [always]
  + BALANCE_LEDGER(the r342/r350 composition re-gate + the
    candidate image + the full chain typing) [always]
  + WORLD_LEDGER(rho_K / decorrelation world columns, lambda_rest
    separation, kappa_int anchors) [always]
  + TWIN_LEDGER(new-column deviations) [always]
  + MUSTFAIL_LEDGER(m1-m5 + scopes) [always].
Honesty before beauty: the identities (i)-(iii) are exact
finite-matrix facts (theorem-grade SKELETON) whose inputs are
measured window scalars (census-grade FLESH); the one-object
clauses are a sealed census on finite windows, never an
asymptotic theorem; a candidate hit at the sealed bars is a
CANDIDATE, never an identification -- the sealed lists contain
neighbours closer than the bars and every ambiguity is printed;
the EXT5 tranche extends the ladder by a factor 1.8 in depth and
STILL cannot separate 3/4 from 2 x 0.38 (the required depths are
printed, that IS the deliverable); rho_r remains a measured
exponent under every verdict -- RHOR_REDUCED reduces and
identifies, it does not derive; the world clause is a measured
discriminator on eight instrumented worlds; no verdict claims
L*, a bound mechanism, a derived 5/7, or RH progress in any
direction.

RECORD TABLES (inserted AFTER the record run -- the only
post-freeze edit besides any DISCLOSED calibration amendments,
which IS the protocol; the two-commit protocol commits this
sealed spec as "r352 pre-freeze" BEFORE the first full
evaluation; the record chronology, verdict and key numbers are
appended here after the record run and nowhere else).

NO RH CLAIM IN EITHER DIRECTION.  NOT evidence for or against RH.
