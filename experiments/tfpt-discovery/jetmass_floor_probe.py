r"""jetmass_floor_probe -- PRIME.JETMASS.FLOOR.01

FROZEN SPEC (2026-08-19).  EXPLORATION ONLY.  This probe writes no
verification module, paper, ledger, website, manifest, Lean file or
status marker.  It makes NO RH claim, NO positivity claim beyond the
per-rung/per-block certificates stated, NO counterexample claim.
It closes no gate and narrows no gate.

=======================================================================
MISSION (THE LAST NAMED ATTACK: prove the JET-MASS-FLOOR -- the single
lambda-uniform arithmetic residue that r169/CDLXXXIV terminally
characterized: delta >= h^{-a} for some polynomial exponent a, where
delta := [sum sin^2(Ag) F(g^2)^2/g^2]/[A_0^2 sum sin^2(Ag)/g^2] is
the source-weighted average of (F/A_0)^2 over the TRUE TAIL ZEROS
(supply window WFULL = (T_z + 6, gamma_7000]; the jet-mass leg of the
proven factorization sigma == (1-slop) delta DC).  Deliverable: the
PRODUCT-FLOOR THEOREM (the rigorous completion of the J1
moment-Laurent chase), the weight-fraction counting (J2), the
assembled endgame chain with the FINAL RESIDUE stated exactly (J3),
and the red-team reconciliation (T4).)

=======================================================================
THE THEOREM LAYER (the product floor; every leg typed)
=======================================================================
THEOREM PF1 (census product identity; PROVEN, exact).  N(y) ==
A_0 prod_j (y - y_j) with deg N = K-1, and F/A_0 ==
prod_j (y - y_j)/prod_{k>=1} (y - b_k) EXACTLY; Vieta trace:
sum_j y_j == B_1 + y_t (with sign(A_2/A_0) = -1, gated per rung;
== r156 SR1/r140 J3).  The trace is COEFFICIENT-LEVEL: sum y_j =
-N_{K-2}/N_{K-1} -- verified per rung without any root-finding.

THEOREM PF2 (the product floor; PROVEN, exact).  Let c* > 1 with
NO census root of Re y >= c* y_t (H1 below), all roots with
Re y_j > -nu (H2 below), and S+ := sum_j max(Re y_j, 0) <=
(1 + kappa + NEGBAR) y_t (trace + H2).  Then for every real
y = z y_t with z > c*:
   F(y)/A_0  >=  (1 - c*/z)^EXP,   EXP := (1 + kappa + NEGBAR)/c*.
Proof legs (each sympy-gated): (i) every real-root factor with
y_j <= 0 satisfies (y - y_j)/(y - b) >= (y - 0)/(y - b) >= ...
drop to 1-side; (ii) complex pairs: |y - y_j|^2 = (y - alpha)^2 +
beta^2 >= (y - alpha)^2; (iii) concavity: -log(1 - u)/u increasing
on (0,1) ==> (1 - alpha/y) >= (1 - c* y_t/y)^{alpha/(c* y_t)} for
0 <= alpha <= c* y_t; (iv) denominator drop: 0 < 1 - b_k/y <= 1.
THE EXPONENT IS THE TRACE: the far-field law 1 - y_t/y is the
kappa -> 0 shadow of this exact bound (measured 1.2 percent
tightness EXPLAINED).  NOTE: this bypasses the J-tail bound of the
contract's J1 Laurent route entirely -- Newton/Vieta resum the
J-tail into root data, and the root cap + trace make it geometric.

THEOREM PF3 (half-plane exclusion; PROVEN, source-pure).  The r140
J1 telescope F - A_0 = sum_{i<=m} A_{2i}/y^i + sum_k w_k b_k^m/
(y^m (y - b_k)) extends to complex y with Re y > b_top via
|y - b_k| >= Re y - b_k and |y|^i >= (Re y)^i:  |F(y) - A_0| <=
ENVJ(Re y).  ENVJ is monotone decreasing (r140 CITED + re-chased),
so ENVJ(c* y_t) < |A_0| ==> NO census root in the half-plane
{Re y >= c* y_t} AND sign F == sign A_0 there: H1 is ONE exact
source evaluation per rung -- NO cache, NO zeros, NO measurement.

H2 (the census leg; MEASURED-POLISHED per rung, finite classical).
The F-census (polyroots on N, rootladder instrument VERBATIM):
all K-1 roots real and NONNEGATIVE (measured: negsum == 0 at all
calibrated rungs; the top root 0.83-0.88 y_t == the r156 escaped
ladder), warded by SR1/Vieta/product-identity devs <= 1e-40.

THEOREM JMF (the jet-mass floor; assembled).  delta >= L(z_0)^2 x
WF(z_0) with L(z_0) = (1 - c*/z_0)^EXP and WF(z_0) = [sum_{g^2 >=
z_0 y_t} sin^2/g^2]/[sum_WFULL sin^2/g^2] (drop nonnegative
below-onset terms + PF2 pointwise above).  TYPING: [PF2: proven
given H1 (certified) + H2 (per-rung classical census)] x [WF:
counting leg -- classical form (G - C)/2 on the suffix window,
same Landau/Gonek class as the r169 DC leg, GONEK-CONSTANT-
UNPRICED; measured ward-class per rung] x [RATE: WF >= 1/poly
<== y_t <= poly(h) == TOPROOT (measured x^4.1; == the r162
THETA-window)].  By r169 SF1/SF3/SF4: sigma >= (1-slop) L^2 WF DC
and ANY polynomial rate is census-absorbable.  THE JET-MASS-FLOOR
IS A THEOREM CONDITIONAL EXACTLY ON {H1 + H2 per rung (finite,
source-classical)} + {suffix equidistribution per census (Landau/
Gonek AS FORM)} + {TOPROOT rate} -- the r169 JETLOCK-MEAS leg (the
per-gamma measured lock indicators) is ELIMINATED from the
ancestor set; the named lambda-uniform residue REDUCES to TOPROOT.

RED TEAM (T4; frozen predictions).  (i) The r156 2-mode witness
c'' = c + d(e_1 + e_2) with frozen d = -A_2 (1 - 1/1000)/(b_2 -
b_1): A_0 invariant, y_t'' = y_t/1000, J_2 inflated x1e6 -- THE
CERTIFICATE REFUSES: c* y_t'' <= b_top for ALL grid c (H1 domain
EMPTY, calibrated) and the census top escapes to 24.9 y_t'' (H2/RC
broken); delta'' at the true zeros moves to 404.3 (the witness
moves the coordinate AND kills the certificate): the floor is
ARITHMETIC-PINNED exactly as r169-SF6 demands -- what algebra
cannot fake is the PAIR {H1, H2} in y_t-units.  (ii) Fake worlds:
y_t_w/b_top <= 0.65 ==> the PF domain {c y_t_w > b_top} is EMPTY
on the whole grid (calibrated SMOOTH x=5) or ENVJ_w >= |A_0_w|:
H1-REFUSED; theta_w = y_t_w/T_z^4 ~ 2.4e-4 (no quartic ground);
tau_w < 0 on the r166 strings; the RAW floor sigma_w > eps_w still
holds (r169 FLOOR-INEQ-WORLD-INSENSITIVE replicated) -- the
arithmetic is the certificate pair + the bridge, not the raw
inequality.  (iii) The r169 delta-toy (delta = 1e-6): violates the
PF2 conclusion at z >= 4 (L^2 ~ 0.52 > 1e-6) ==> NOT realizable
under H1+H2 (modus tollens): the theorem's content is exactly the
exclusion of the free-scalar toys.  (iv) Lattice toy: sin == 0
kills WF (the counting leg is the arithmetic input, as in SF6).

AMENDMENT 1 (post-run-1, disclosed; run 1 = 34/36 at SPEC_SHA
4f8d05e02cb020f9, log kept as the pre-amendment record
jmf_run1.log).  TWO INSTRUMENT RE-TYPINGS, no bar or criterion
moved on the delivered floor chain; every theorem/certificate/
census/pointwise/block/graph gate passed run 1 unchanged (the
full census landed complete-real nonnegative at ALL 25 rungs
including degree-116 at h = 28, and the PF pointwise floor held
at every one of the ~100k zero checks):
(a) G41: the RATE_MARGIN bar (delta_cert/eps >= 1e6) was frozen
over all onset rungs, but at h = 18 the WF(4) window is squeezed
against the FIXED cache top (WF = 0.0008, measured margin 5.4e5):
the same CACHE-TOP-LIMITED instrument class as the r169
AMENDMENT-1 rate fit and r137 JETCERT-DEPTH-LIMITED, here at the
margin bar.  FIX: the margin bar is restricted by the SAME frozen
h-only CLEAN_FIT criterion sqrt(4 y_t) <= gtop/2 already used by
G43 (PRE-ADOPTED at freeze for the fit); beyond it the rows are
typed CACHE-TOP-LIMITED and stay printed (the run-1 fail row is
itself the measured window-loss law and stays in the record).
No window or bar moved; a deeper zeros cache extends the clean
range -- pure instrument depth.
(b) G50-G52: the structural rows y_t_w/b_top <= 1.0 and theta_w
<= 1e-3 were calibrated on SMOOTH x=5 only; SCRARITH x=6 measures
1.822/1.9e-3 while ALL refusal legs held (tau_w < 0 on the r166
strings, mechanism loss < 0, H1-REFUSED at every grid c, raw
floor holds).  FIX: y_t_w/b_top and theta_w are re-typed
REPORTED-DIAGNOSTIC (printed, not gated -- they are not uniform
refusal coordinates across fake worlds); the gate's refusal
criterion is the certificate set {tau strings, BA3-bridge loss,
H1-REFUSED, raw-floor world-insensitivity}, which is what
separates the worlds.

AMENDMENT 2 (post-run-2, disclosed; run 2 = 35/36 at SPEC_SHA
92c895a4053dd781, log kept as the pre-amendment record
jmf_run2.log; the ONLY failing gate was G51).  ONE RED-TEAM
RE-ADJUDICATION, no bar or criterion moved on the delivered floor
chain: run 2 isolates the G51 failing leg as H1-REFUSED at
SCRARITH x=6 -- with y_t_w = 1.822 b_top that world HAS a genuine
far-field domain and the ENVJ certificate is SATISFIABLE there
(measured).  THIS IS THE HONEST READING, and it is CONSISTENT:
the pair {H1, H2} ==> PF is pure algebra, valid in ANY world (a
theorem must be world-blind), and indeed delta_w = 1.33 = O(1) at
that rung -- the r169 FLOOR-INEQ-WORLD-INSENSITIVE reading
extends to the CERTIFICATE itself wherever a fake world grows a
far field.  The frozen H1-REFUSED prediction (calibrated on
SMOOTH x=5 where the domain is empty) over-generalized.  What
separates the worlds, verified: (i) the BA3 bridge (mechanism
loss < 0 -- the GW identity connecting the floor to tau is FALSE
in every fake world), (ii) THE SIZE LAW (theta_w = y_t_w/T_z^4 <=
1.9e-3 at every control rung vs MAIN theta in the r162 quartic
window 0.17-0.26: separation factor >= 50, now GATED as
SIZE-SEPARATOR), (iii) tau_w < 0, and (iv) the WITNESS direction
(G53: the 2-mode witness DOES kill H1 + H2 in y_t''-units --
the certificate's arithmetic pinning is the witness statement,
not the fake-world statement).  FIX: H1-refusal becomes
REPORTED-DIAGNOSTIC per control rung; the gated refusal criterion
is {tau strings, BA3-bridge loss, raw-floor world-insensitivity,
SIZE-SEPARATOR theta_w <= 1e-2 AND min MAIN theta / max theta_w
>= 10}.  Run 3 = run of record at the amended SPEC_SHA; run 4 =
deterministic re-run.
