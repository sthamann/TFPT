r"""ground_residue_obs_probe -- PRIME.GROUND.RESIDUE.OBS.01

FROZEN SPEC (2026-08-21).  EXPLORATION ONLY.  This probe writes no
verification module, paper, ledger, website, manifest, Lean file or
status marker.  It makes NO RH claim, NO positivity claim beyond the
per-rung finite statements gated below, NO counterexample claim.  It
closes no gate and narrows no gate.  Concurrent-lane files (the
pi-pattern-scan lane, the census-spectral-lift lane, the independent
session's untracked probes, sieve4_helper.bin) are not touched.

=======================================================================
MISSION (round ~186: ground-state boundary observability).  H3 of the
prime-front terminal residue (PRIME.RESIDUE.EXTERNAL.01) demands
y_t = |A_2/A_0| <= 0.155 T_z^4 -- a LOWER bound on |A_0(d_h)| against
|A_2(d_h)| for the ACTUAL ground state d_h of the wall M_h.  Every
frame/uniform route died trying to control ALL directions (r180 dof
kill, r181 sub-dof kill, l1 majorants, DK norms r177).  THIS round
uses the one fact those routes were forbidden to use: d_h satisfies
M_h d_h = tau_h d_h.  Central object: the scalar resolvent
   R_h(z) = l_0^T (z I - M_h)^{-1} l_0
(NOTE the honest sign convention: with (z I - M)^{-1} the function is
anti-Herglotz, R(zbar) = conj R(z), Im R < 0 in the upper half plane,
and the residue at the ground pole is +|l_0 . d|^2/||d||^2; the
contract's (M - z I)^{-1} convention flips the residue sign -- both
stated, the POSITIVE normalized form is gated).  Goals:
  G1  THE EXACT RESIDUE IDENTITY + FESHBACH/SCHUR SCALAR FORM.
      Res_{z=tau} R_h(z) = |l_0(d_h)|^2/||d_h||^2 = A_0^2 (builder's
      d unit); Schur complement of (z I - M) onto e_0 = l_0/||l_0||:
      R_h(z) = ||l_0||^2 / w(z),
      w(z) = z - alpha - m^T (z I - B)^{-1} m,
      alpha = e_0^T M e_0,  m = the compression coupling Q M e_0,
      B = the codimension-1 compression of M to ker l_0; the residue
      bound becomes  A_0^2 = ||l_0||^2 / w'(tau)  with
      w'(tau) = 1 + m^T (tau I - B)^{-2} m.  ROUND KEY QUESTION: is
      w'(tau) source-side expressible WITHOUT the eigenvector?
  G2  THE TRANSVERSALITY FORM.  gap := mu_1(B) - tau >= 0 by Cauchy
      interlacing (codim-1 compression: tau <= mu_1 <= tau_2); the
      gap and the residue are linked through the SAME w(z):
      w'(tau) = 1 + sum_j (m.u_j)^2/(mu_j - tau)^2, hence the exact
      two-sided sandwich
        ||l_0||^2 gap^2/(gap^2 + ||m||^2) <= A_0^2
                       <= ||l_0||^2 gap^2/(gap^2 + (m.u_1)^2).
      Ladder measured at all reachable rungs: sign, size, exponent,
      demand ratio (H3 margin), fake worlds, r172-class witness.
  G3  NEW-QUANTITY ADJUDICATION (tau-screen, strict): (i) log-log
      slopes of {gap, w'(tau), demand margin} against tau_h across
      rungs -- slope ~1 == relabeling; (ii) ancestry DFS: NO leg may
      consume TAUPOS or TLAWCAP (the A_0-triangle is THIS contract's
      nearest landmine -- the loop guard is extra-sharp: tau_h enters
      ONLY as a measured per-rung eigenvalue scalar, never as a sign
      hypothesis, and no TLAWCAP currency is read anywhere);
      (iii) composed-chain demand typing per leg:
      EXACT / SOURCE-CLASSICAL / MEASURED / RELABELED.
  G4  ATTACK-TOOL PRICING on whatever leg stays live: Feshbach
      (delivered in G1), rank-one spectral flow (delivered in G2),
      Riemann-Hilbert/IIKS integrable structure (the wall's own
      displacement structure measured + symbolically located),
      source-specific Carleman (classical anchors cited, priced).

=======================================================================
THE FOUR SECTIONS AS EXECUTED (verdicts frozen from the ONE disclosed
pre-freeze calibration pass, calib_gro_pass1.log; record values below
ARE the calibrated numbers; two pre-spec convention scratches at h=5/8
were run and deleted before this spec was written, DISCLOSED -- they
fixed the sign convention, validated the Householder/compression
pipeline, and discovered the one-function Loewner fact gated in G60)
=======================================================================
G1 (THE IDENTITY, EXACT AND MACHINE-VERIFIED AT EVERY RUNG).  The
residue identity and the Feshbach/Schur scalar form are proven exact
on the sympy layer (rational-orthogonal 3x3 instance from the
quaternion (1,2,3,4), plus the fully generic symbolic 2x2) and gated
at ALL 14 reachable rungs: |A_0^2 w'(tau)/||l_0||^2 - 1| <=
7.8e-45 at every rung (worst; typical far smaller), the l_2 branch
identity |A_2^2 w_2'(tau)/||l_2||^2 - 1| (<= 3.3e-46) and the TWO-
FUNCTIONAL H3 form y_t^2 == (||l_2||^2/||l_0||^2) (w_0'(tau)/
w_2'(tau)) exact at all four L2_RUNGS (<= 1.5e-45).  THE
KEY-QUESTION ANSWER, typed honestly in two halves: (YES) w'(tau) is
expressible from {alpha, m, B} -- all EXACT-LINEAR in the atom
transforms (prime block rebuilt from the sieve atoms, ward dev 0.0
EXACT at all F_RUNGS, weight-doubling exact 0.0) --
plus the ONE measured scalar tau_h; the wall EIGENVECTOR d is
ELIMINATED by the Schur reduction: the A_0 floor becomes a derivative
bound on the explicit scalar function w (a genuinely new coordinate
system, prior-art-linked: w'(tau) = ||l||^2 P'(tau)/N(tau) is the
CDLI adjugate identity A_0^2 = N(tau)/P'(tau) in Schur coordinates,
G16 -- SAME-IDENTITY-NEW-COORDINATES, disclosed).  (BUT) the demand
mass inside w'(tau) concentrates on ONE term: (m.u_1)^2/gap^2 -- u_1
the ground eigenvector of the COMPRESSION B: the eigenvector demand
DESCENDS one level rather than vanishing (EIGENVECTOR-DESCENDS-NOT-
ELIMINATED); the fully source-priced form (||m|| for the overlap)
loses the measured 11.2-90.7 orders (the overlap spread
log10((m.u_1)^2/||m||^2) ladder -11.24 (h=4) .. -90.72 (h=20),
G25/G28).
G2 (THE TRANSVERSALITY LADDER, MEASURED).  gap > 0 at ALL 14 rungs
(strict interlacing == A_0 != 0, both directions proven exact G13),
NO precision refusals at the disclosed dps schedule; the gap is TINY
against the spectral gap: log10(gap/fullgap) = -5.15 at h = 4
falling to -8.52 at h = 16 and -9.00 at h = 20 (record table) -- the
arithmetic ray couples the ground state to ker l_0 ANOMALOUSLY
WEAKLY, rung after rung.  THE DISGUISE EXHIBIT: gap * S2 * ||l_0||^2
/ A_0^2 = 1 - eps with eps <= 2.55e-6 at EVERY rung (record): the
transversality gap IS the residue divided by the explicit
second-order moment S2 -- the same quantity in matrix coordinates,
NOT an independent handle.  DEMAND: the ||m||-priced gap route to H3
FAILS at every rung by 5.1-45.0 orders (margin ladder
gap/g_req(X_meas), record -5.08 (h=4) .. -45.05 (h=20)); the
trivial-ceiling demand X_triv is SOLVABLE (X_triv < ||l_0||^2) at
all rungs but its margin is worse by the ||l_2||/|A_2| slack; the
exact overlap-priced form carries BY IDENTITY but consumes u_1.
WORLDS: identities hold world-blind (<= 4.4e-59 in all 7 control
cells); the VALUES separate cleanly: fake-world log10(gap/fullgap) =
-0.17..-2.02 (top-of-spectrum class, tau < 0 in every fake cell) vs
MAIN -5.15/-5.96/-6.88 at the same x -- the anomalously small gap
fraction is arithmetic-specific with >= 1 dex clearance (same
signature class as r182's mass-location separation, MEASURED).
WITNESS (r172 recipe VERBATIM, h = 5): y_t'' = 1000.0 y_t at source
cost 8.1e-2 (A_0 preserved, dev 1.1e-53); the witness ray EXITS THE
EIGENMANIFOLD -- eigen-residual 1e-2.26 vs the true ray's 1e-60.75
vs the full spectral gap 1e-10.45, i.e. 1e8.2 x the FULL spectral
gap -- and the l_2-residue identity DETECTS it at deviation 1.1e6
(=~ W^2) while the l_0 identity stays blind (dev 1.2e-1, A_0
preserved by construction, disclosed): the residue observable pair
{l_0, l_2} separates the witness class the frame routes could not;
the gap itself is witness-INVARIANT (matrix-side, definitional --
typed, not sold).  ALT JETS (r182): SIGNFLIP/UNIFORM/MAGSCRAM rays
sit 8.9-52.6 orders off the l_0-residue identity (order-distance
|log10 ratio|, record) PLUS one exact A_0-null exhibit -- UNIFORM at
h = 13 (K = 42 even: sum_k (-1)^k = 0 exactly, the identity fires in
the zero-residue direction, order-distance INF; amendment A1): the
identity pins the true ray.
G3 (ADJUDICATION).  TAU-SCREEN: slope log10(gap) vs log10(tau) =
+1.011 (R^2 1.000), slope log10(w') = -1.003, slope
log10(margin_meas) = +0.519 (record): the RAW gap RIDES the
tau/conditioning currency inside the declared ride band (0.7, 1.3)
in |slope|, w' anti-rides in the same currency; the margin slope
+0.52 sits BELOW the ride band (mixed currency: the gap ride divided
by the demand growth -- NOT typed independent, disclosed) -- per the
round-1 scope command the RAW-GAP FLOOR LEG IS FLAGGED
RELABELED-AND-STOPPED: no asymptotic claim, the gap ladder is the
residue ladder in matrix coordinates (G29 exhibit), its decay
exponent beta(gap vs h: -4.85 dex/rung R^2 1.000) is the known
conditioning schedule in a second currency.  WHAT IS GENUINELY NEW
(typed): (a) the Schur/Feshbach COORDINATES themselves (w, alpha, m,
B source-linear; eigenvector eliminated at identity level) -- EXACT;
(b) the one-function Loewner structure of the wall (G60) -- EXACT,
world-blind, source enters ONLY through the potential f; (c) the
overlap-spread ladder and the gap-fraction ladder -- MEASURED, new
observables (world-separating in the measured sense); (d) the
witness-detection pair {l_0, l_2} residue identities -- EXACT + the
witness's eigen-residual price MEASURED.  ANCESTRY: the A_0-triangle
(TAUPOS/TLAWCAP/EPSLOCK) is DETECTED as a flagged cycle and consumed
by NOTHING delivered -- tau_h enters as a measured scalar only, no
sign hypothesis, no TLAWCAP currency read; census-forall-k,
Gonek-1984, Montgomery-PC likewise flagged, not consumed; min-cut
flows 4/5/5/6 replicate r135 -- this round adds NO flow.  COMPOSED
CHAIN [gap floor + ||m|| price + trivial A_2 ceiling => H3]: every
arrow EXACT, the gap-floor INPUT is the one open leg and it is
RELABELED (rides tau) -- the chain is a coordinate change of the
known wall, honestly so typed; no RH-strong input demanded anywhere
(the chain is per-rung finite; the lambda-uniform gap floor is NAMED
as the open input and NOT claimed).
G4 (TOOL PRICING, with numbers).  FESHBACH: DELIVERED-EXACT (this
round's G1; per-rung identity, no residual demand).  RANK-ONE
SPECTRAL FLOW / INTERLACING: DELIVERED-EXACT as the secular
representation + sandwich (G13/G23/G24); QUANTITATIVELY LOSSY in its
fully-source-priced form: 11.2-90.7 orders (the overlap spread), and
its strict-positivity content is EQUIVALENT to A_0 != 0 (both
directions exact G13) -- qualitative relabel, disclosed.  RIEMANN-
HILBERT/IIKS: the wall in raw coordinates has displacement rank
EXACTLY 2 against diag(b) (s3/s1 <= 2.6e-16 at all F_RUNGS + h = 13,
float64 floor; reconstruction dev <= 1.1e-15) == ONE-FUNCTION
LOEWNER MATRIX Raw[i,j] = (f_i - f_j)/(b_i - b_j), f = f_pole +
f_arch + 2 om pj proven per-block symbolically (G17) and the prime
potential -2 om_k pj_k re-derived from the sieve atoms at F_RUNGS
(<= 1.2e-61, mp); prior art
honestly separated: r45-class LOEWNER-DEAD killed the LADDER-as-
Loewner-flow identification, THIS is the wall matrix itself being a
Loewner/Pick divided-difference kernel -- the classical dictionary
is Loewner 1934 (operator monotonicity == Loewner-matrix PSD) and
IIKS 1990/Deift-Its-Krasovsky 2011 for the resolvent asymptotics of
integrable kernels; the CDLI relative-Szego/IIKS candidate is the
SAME class on another family: typed NEEDS-NAMED-EXTERNAL-TOOL
(carries structurally: R_h(z) is the scalar resolvent of an explicit
one-function Loewner kernel -- a well-posed classical object; killed
nowhere; the lambda-uniform statement is the open input).  CARLEMAN:
the needed classical form is a quantitative vanishing-order/doubling
bound at the functional l_0 for the ground state of a discrete
operator; continuum anchor Donnelly-Fefferman 1988 (Invent. Math.
93, 161-183: vanishing order <= C sqrt(lambda)); the DISCRETE
regime is the named risk -- plain discrete UCP FAILS on lattices and
robust discrete Carleman constants degrade as e^{-c/h_mesh}
(Fernandez-Bertolin/Roncal/Rueland, Calc. Var. PDE 60 (2021) 239,
DOI 10.1007/s00526-021-02098-z; Fernandez-Bertolin/Vega, J. Funct.
Anal. 272 (2017) 4853-4869): with the wall's mesh pi/a and the
conditioning ladder collapsing FASTER than any e^{-c/h} at the
measured -4.85 dex/rung, the tool is typed NEEDS-NAMED-EXTERNAL-
TOOL, LOW-CARRY (the exponential-constant wall is named with

Honest content: (a) the exact residue/Feshbach identity puts the A_0
floor into eigenvector-free coordinates at every reachable rung --
the round's key question answers YES at the identity level, and the
demand honestly DESCENDS to the compression ground overlap rather
than vanishing; (b) the transversality gap exists, is strictly
positive, and is machine-shown to be the residue in disguise (secular
ratio 1 - eps); its ladder rides tau -- the raw-gap floor leg is
RELABELED and stopped per the round-1 scope; (c) the genuinely new
exact structure is the one-function Loewner form of the wall and the
{l_0, l_2} residue pair as a witness-class detector; the genuinely
new measured objects are the gap-fraction and overlap-spread ladders
(world-separating in the measured sense); (d) nothing closes, nothing
upgrades, the census-forall-k loop and the A_0-triangle stay flagged
and unconsumed.  NO RH CLAIM.

CALIBRATION (disclosed): ONE structural smoke
(ground_residue_obs_probe.smoke1.log, rungs 4/5/8, 33/33 -- the
record comparisons are vacuous pre-freeze by design) and ONE full
pre-freeze calibration pass (calib_gro_pass1.log, --mode calib,
32/33): the single calib FAIL was G43, root-caused to the PRE-FREEZE
METRIC not the battery -- the deviation |ratio - 1| saturates at 1
on the exact A_0-null (UNIFORM jet at h = 13, K = 42 even: parity
sum (-1)^k == 0) instead of registering the total break.  AMENDMENT
A1 (the one amendment, disclosed): the alt-jet metric was replaced
by the two-sided order-distance |log10(A_0(ray)^2 w'/||l_0||^2)|
with INF at the exact null, and ALT_DEV_MIN 1e3 was renamed/retyped
ALT_ORD_MIN 3.0 orders; the null is now gated as the STRONGEST break
(the identity fires in the zero-residue direction), not a failure.
AT FREEZE the placeholder record tables were replaced by the
calibrated numbers and the screen verdict enums were resolved from
the measured slopes (GAP-RIDES-TAU fired as anticipated by the
pre-registered prior; the world-separation and witness-detection
legs gated as measured), all disclosed; NO bar, grid, dps rung,
recipe or control inherited from r171-r182 moved; the ONE moved
constant is the A1 metric/threshold above.
DETERMINISM: no randomness anywhere (the MAGSCRAM permutation is the
deterministic golden map); ProcessPool results keyed; run2 must be
identical modulo wall-clock tokens (lines carrying 'WALL').
