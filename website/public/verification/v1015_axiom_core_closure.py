"""v1015 -- axiom-core closure: character-blind P-dem response
derives both W-bridge premises at finite level (Monday-morning
harvest, 2026-08-31).  No marker move.

Provenance: experiments/tfpt-discovery/pdem_character_blind_detresponse_probe.py
(7/7) together with P-anch already in v1014 (winding/triple lock).
Probe constructions are imported; experiments/ is not a
verification-module import in the sense of a claim source.

THE POINT.  The missing object of v1014 is now constructed.

  [E-finite] the abelian total-charge insertion A = I_deck is
        character-blind: r = (1,1,1) exactly at collar sizes 12 and
        16, democracy residual 0, winding W = 1; the normalized
        response is the v4 shift 6 ones e1^T.
  [E-finite] mutants split correctly: a deck-invariant character
        insertion through P_1 gives (1,0,0); the deck-breaking
        closed large-gauge generator splits (5/4, 1, 5/4) and
        leaks character subspaces.  Deck commutation alone is not
        the premise.
  [E-finite] P-anch remains DERIVED (v1014): e1 = R^{-1}(1,1,2)^T.
  Closure: BOTH W-bridge premises are now derived at finite level;
        the axiom-core remainder is ZERO modulo the externalized
        MMST identification.  AX.P2.01 typing UNMOVED (the finite
        derivations are shadows; the continuum identification is the
        same external leg).  TFPT.TOE.COMPLETE.01 T1 note: the
        structure-postulate route is now fully premise-supported
        at finite level.

MUST-FAIL: character-dependent coupling is deck-invariant but not
democratic; deck-breaking mutant leaks character subspaces.

HONEST SCOPE (firewall): finite 2+1D QWZ collar x regular mu4 deck
module only; CHIRAL4D / Bismut-Freed / the continuum MMST
identification stay [O].  AX.P2.01 stays an axiom.  Python-only /
Wolfram mirror deferred (engine DEFERRED_NO_ENGINE).
