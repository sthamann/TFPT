"""v772 -- PRIME.QFFESHBACH.01: the fixed-d pair of the qf offensive, one module from two probes, combined verdict FESHBACH-PARTIAL / EDGE-KEEPS-MOVING -- fixed-d Feshbach closed PERMANENTLY on every reachable surface.  PART 1 (FESHBACH-PARTIAL, GATES 9/12 with exactly CAUCHY-6/GAP-7/GAP-8 the preregistered fails, GUARDS+CONTROLS 28/28; 1e8 comb): the d = 6 Feshbach reduction is EXACT and the right well-defined object -- the reconstruction identity holds at max rel residual 8.8e-13 against INDEPENDENT complex dense solves over 5 rungs x 5 z-points, matrix-Herglotz certified on every gated rung (max eig Im F~ = -1.000e-2 = -h exactly; min eig Im F~^{-1} = +98.8), band separated (min rel gap 0.1008 at M = 1096), coupling Ward P A Q = 0 measured at 3.1e-15..6.1e-15 -- but CAUCHY-6 fails on the slope clause (b2 = +0.006/X < 0.02): the tail flattens exactly where mode 7 grazes the band edge.  THE MOVING-EDGE PICTURE: d = 7 passes CAUCHY strongly (med5 0.207, b2 = +0.502/X) but loses separation at the top rung (gap 7/8 = 0.0613 at M = 1176); d = 8 has an internal 8/9 crossing at M = 976 (gap 5.4e-4, transport angle 87.2 deg) -- no fixed d in {6, 7, 8} owns a uniformly separated band on 888..1176.  PART 2 (EDGE-KEEPS-MOVING, GUARDS+CONTROLS 20/20, 160.3 s; 1e9 comb to X = 20.6875, 49,154,321 atoms): the 7/8 edge does NOT separate again -- it CLOSES INTO AN AVOIDED CROSSING (gap falls from 0.0613 at M = 1176 through 0.0209 to 0.0039 at M = 1240, relaxes to ~0.011, decays to 0.0074 at the top rung 1324; lam7 = 7.9351e-5 / lam8 = 7.9946e-5 / lam9 = 9.1935e-5 form a CLUSTER below thr 1e-4) while the transported d = 7 block stays Cauchy straight through the crossing (109 increments 2.72e-6 -> 3.94e-7, med5 0.181, b2 = +0.061/X): convergence was never the problem, band OWNERSHIP is.  MODE-DESCENT CADENCE (fit-free): entries at M = 888 / 992 / 1108 / 1276 (the 9th mode enters inside the extension), inter-entry gaps DX = 1.6250 / 1.8125 / 2.6250 -- mean 2.0208, rel spread 0.381 > the frozen 0.25 regularity bar: the cadence is real but NOT regular; the spacing WIDENS with depth (third gap 1.6x the first) -- the honest surprise and the number the cell-cocycle module must carry.  Reported: the d = 6 grazing RESOLVES (6/7 gap recovers to 0.4333 at the top -- the separated object is the 6-band again under a 7/8/9 cluster); the settled q_f levels hold to 0.87..1.09x over 2.3 more X units (drainage confirmation for free; extension fall rates +0.050..+0.083/X sit slightly above the 0.05 plateau bar, typed).  NO RH claim, no claim beyond X = 20.6875, no eps-uniformity.

PROVENANCE: discovery probes qf_feshbach_effective_probe.py (2026-08-05, 24.4 s, GATES 9/12, GUARDS+CONTROLS 28/28, verdict FESHBACH-PARTIAL; ONE DECLARED GUARD-NORMALIZATION CORRECTION carried honestly into this module: the first execution (25.0 s) was invalidated SOLELY by a dimensionally wrong normalization of the G1.9 z-independence Ward -- the measured float deviation 1.5e-16, machine-perfect for the exact shift identity, was compared against 1e-12 x the increment scale (2.7e-6) instead of 1e-12 x the block ENTRY scale (1e-2); the Ward normalization was corrected, NO gate bar was touched, and the repeat run produced IDENTICAL gate outcomes -- deterministic construction, both runs reported) and qf_edge_separation_probe.py (2026-08-05, first and only preregistered run, 160.3 s on the predeclared 1e9 comb, GUARDS+CONTROLS 20/20, verdict EDGE-KEEPS-MOVING, carried by the EDGE-A failure alone -- the frozen KM2 clause stays quiet because the cadence is not regular at the 0.25 bar).  Merged per the v518/v668/v763 precedent: part 1 verbatim at module level (sibling imports point at v563/v755/v766/v770; epstein_firewall_probe stays a read-only discovery import); part 2 verbatim inside an isolated function scope; numbers unchanged.  run() encodes both preregistered gate patterns as the expected outcome (v757 precedent).  RUNTIME NOTE (suite budget, v677 ~420 s precedent -- no thinning): part 2 re-derives the 1e9 sieve in-process (benchmarked 12.3 s / 13.5 GB for the sieve alone, ~160 s total on the reference machine); the frozen ladders are kept at full depth so the promoted module reproduces the frozen verdict verbatim.

PART 1 -- qf_feshbach_effective_probe.py (docstring verbatim):
QF-OFFENSIVE strand 3, module 3 -- the Feshbach effective block:
reduce the full window operator EXACTLY onto the slow band and decide
whether the transported effective block converges along the ladder,
so that the infinite positivity wall becomes the convergence of ONE
small matrix function.  qf_feshbach_effective_probe.

Exploration only (tfpt-experiment firewall): NOT wired into
run_all.py, no ledger row, no paper edit, no website edit, NO RH
CLAIM, and this probe writes no files.  It never reads a zero
ordinate and never evaluates the target before every source object
is built and SHA-256 frozen.  The band, the transport and the
effective block are built exclusively from the source window
operator -- never from target data.

INPUT STATE (frozen findings, none re-adjudicated here):
  *  qf_drainage_probe -- QF-SETTLES-POSITIVE 14/14 on the 1e8 comb
     (X <= 18.375): the battery/near-kernel pairing settles at
     positive per-function constants (R2 family 0.225..0.358, R1
     family 0.008..0.079) -- the Feshbach treatment is MANDATORY.
     Typed cautions carried forward: 7th/8th threshold crossings at
     M = 992 / ~1108; 6/7 gap bottoms at 0.1008 (M ~ 1100) then
     recovers to 0.1397 (M = 1176); single deep mode persists.
  *  qf_spectral_bundle_probe -- QF-BUNDLE-PARTIAL: the Kato/polar
     transport of the band frame is well-defined (angles <= 2.72
     deg on 888..972) and gauge-covariant; machinery reused
     verbatim (sign_fix imported read-only).
  *  Holonomy check (drainage probe): transported coordinates move
     with O(1) velocity in X (step exponent ~1) -- convergence must
     come from velocity decay along X, which is exactly what the
     Cauchy gates below measure on the effective block.

OBJECT: per rung X_k and band dimension d, the Feshbach (Schur/
Livsic) map on Ran P with P = P_k^(d) = span of the d LOWEST
eigenmodes (band rule), Q = I - P:

    F_X(z) = P (A_X - z) P  -  P A_X Q [Q (A_X - z) Q]^{-1} Q A_X P,

restricted to Ran P and expressed in the band eigenframe; the
TRANSPORTED effective block is  F~_X(z) = U_{1,X}^* F_X(z) U_{1,X}
with the chained Kato/polar transport U_{1,X} per band dimension.
The reconstruction identity  [P (A_X - z)^{-1} P]|_{Ran P} =
F_X(z)^{-1}  is part of the deliverable and is gated at machine
precision against an INDEPENDENT dense solve of (A_X - z).

PREDECLARED ALGEBRA (honesty, stated BEFORE the run):
  (1) P is a SPECTRAL projector of A_X itself, so P A_X Q = 0
      IDENTICALLY: the Schur correction vanishes analytically and
      F_X(z) = Lambda_d(X) - z on the band frame.  The correction
      is nevertheless COMPUTED from the measured coupling matrix
      E = V_d^T A V_c (a commutation Ward, expected at machine
      scale) and carried through every formula, so nothing is
      assumed; the reconstruction gate is then a genuine TWO-PATH
      numerical Ward (eigh path vs independent dense solve).
  (2) z-shift identity: up to the machine-scale correction,
      F~_X(z) - F~_X(z') = (z' - z) I because the chained transport
      is orthogonal -- the Cauchy increments of F~ are
      z-INDEPENDENT.  This is declared so the per-(d, z) tables
      cannot be sold as independent evidence: they are gated once
      per d at the frozen reference point and a z-independence Ward
      binds all other gated cells to it.
  (3) Herglotz orientation: for self-adjoint A_X the effective
      block itself is ANTI-Herglotz (Im F~(z) <= 0 for Im z > 0;
      with zero coupling Im F~ = -Im z * I exactly) and the
      Herglotz object of the boundary-triple route is the INVERSE
      M~(z) = F~(z)^{-1} = the transported compressed resolvent,
      with Im M~(z) >= 0.  BOTH sides are gated (matrix
      inequalities up to the frozen numerical floor); they are
      exact structural identities whose float verification is the
      content -- the NON-trivial gates of this probe are the
      band-gap gates, the Cauchy gates and the d-adjudication.
  (4) Q-block separation at fixed z = -eps: for spectral P its
      spectrum is exactly {lambda_i(X) + eps : i > d}, so the
      margin profile IS the lambda_{d+1}(X) profile shifted by eps
      -- reported per (d, eps); this fixed-z separation is a
      DIFFERENT object from a global positive lower bound on A
      (which remains forbidden in gates; PD stays measured output).

FROZEN CONSTRUCTION (reused machinery verbatim, none invented):
  deep comb = deployed von Mangoldt sieve at ATOM_MAX = 1e8
      (drainage-probe cap, re-derived in-process -- probes write no
      files); M_CAP = 1178, M_TOP = 1176 (X = 18.375); guards:
      overlap exact, Chebyshev envelope, parent-tower prefix Ward.
  gated ladder GLAD = 888..1176 step 4 (73 rungs, 72 increments);
      step-1 sub-ladder HOLO_LAD = 1160..1176 (REPORTED only).
  band dimensions D_SET = (6, 7, 8) -- ALL THREE preregistered (the
      carried-forward caution as a predeclared question); the
      adjudication rule is FROZEN: the verdict names the SMALLEST d
      that passes all four gates (gap, Herglotz, reconstruction,
      Cauchy); no post-hoc choice.
  transport per d: sign-fixed d lowest eigenvectors (sign fix
      gauge-irrelevant, bundle lesson), overlap S_k = V_{k+1}^T
      pad(V_k), polar factor Q_k = UW^T of the SVD (floor
      sigma_min >= 1e-8, else transport undefined = kill), chained
      R_1 = I, R_{k+1} = Q_k R_k; F~_k(z) = R_k^T [Lambda_d(X_k) -
      z - C_d(z)] R_k with the measured Schur correction C_d(z) =
      E_d^T diag(1/(lambda_c - z))^{-1}-free form E_d(z-resolved),
      E_d = coupling rows (see (1)).
  evaluation points (frozen): gated real set z = -eps, eps in
      EPS_GATED = (1e-1, 1e-2, 1e-3) (X-before-eps order: every
      statistic runs along X at fixed z); reference cell Z_REF =
      -1e-2; Herglotz points ZC = (i h, -1e-3 + i h) with h = 1e-2.
FROZEN GATES (per band dimension d):
  GAP-d   band/bulk separation on the gated range: min over GLAD of
          (lambda_{d+1} - lambda_d)/lambda_{d+1} >= GAP_BAR = 0.10
          (the d = 6 minimum 0.1008 lives here; if the d = 6
          Q-block inherits the 7th/8th near-modes this is exactly
          where d = 7/8 may win); full profiles + argmin reported.
  HERG-d  matrix-Herglotz certificates on EVERY gated rung at both
          ZC points: max eig Im F~(z) <= HERG_FLOOR = 1e-10 AND
          min eig Im F~(z)^{-1} >= -HERG_FLOOR.
  REC-d   reconstruction identity at the frozen Ward rungs
          RECON_RUNGS = (888, 968, 1048, 1128, 1176) and ALL five z
          points: max rel entrywise residual
          | V_d^T (A - z)^{-1} V_d - F_d(z)^{-1} | / max|F^{-1}|
          <= REC_BAR = 1e-10 (independent dense solve).
  CAUCHY-d  the decider: delta_k = max-entry |F~_{k+1}(Z_REF) -
          F~_k(Z_REF)| over the 72 increments; oscillation-aware
          frozen statistic (house pattern): med5(LAST5)/med5(FIRST5)
          <= C_MED = 0.5 AND second-half falling rate b2 >=
          C_SLOPE = 0.02 per X unit (hbp.fit_rate verbatim);
          increment blocks FIRST5 = 1..5, LAST5 = 68..72, second
          half = 37..72; increment X = right-rung X.  Per-(d, eps)
          cells are bound to the Z_REF cell by the z-independence
          Ward ZW <= 1e-12 x scale (predeclared algebra (2)).
KILLS (frozen, from the offensive's list):
  K1 RH-strength bound audit: every gated quantity is a band-
     interior gap ratio, a fixed-z separation, a bounded transported
     matrix entry, a machine-precision identity residual, or a
     med5/slope statistic of these -- no global positivity of A, no
     1/eps, no PD margin enters any gate (structural audit printed
     with measured scales);
  K2 a positive lower eigenvalue bound on A entering a gate --
     forbidden; only the fixed-z Q-block separation (different
     object, declared in (4)) is used;
  K3 mode selection by target deviation -- AST firewall + the band
     rule is an eigenvalue-order rule of the source operator only;
  K4 transport undefined: sigma_min(S_k) < 1e-8 for some d (a
     principal angle at 90 deg);
  K5 the effective block not convergent for ANY d in {6, 7, 8}.
GUARDS (must pass or the run is invalid): G0.1 AST firewall; G0.2
  SHA-256 freeze BEFORE any comb data (battery not needed here --
  the block is battery-free; the frozen objects are ladders, D_SET,
  z points, bars, adjudication rule); G0.3 reach census + runtime
  cap 1200 s predeclared; G1.1 deep-table overlap exact; G1.2
  Chebyshev envelope; G1.3 parent tower comb consistency; G1.4
  prefix Ward; G1.5 drainage reproduction Ward: 6/7 rel gap(972) =
  0.3441 +- 2e-3, 6/7 rel gap(1176) = 0.1397 +- 2e-3, threshold
  count(1176) = 8, deep count(1176) = 1, lambda_min(1176) =
  3.882e-6 +- 2e-8; G1.6 measured PD (report, never in a gate);
  G1.7 coupling/commutation Ward max |E_d| <= 1e-8 on every gated
  rung (predeclared algebra (1)); G1.8 transport orthogonality Ward
  <= 1e-10 per d; G1.9 z-independence Ward (predeclared algebra
  (2)) rel <= 1e-12 across the gated eps cells; G1.10 boundedness:
  every |F~| entry <= lambda_max(band) + |z| + 1e-9, every overlap
  singular value <= 1 + 1e-12.
CONTROLS (mandatory, must fire; frozen fire rule): the same
  slow-band Feshbach reading on CS position-scramble (deep comb,
  seed 7, rungs 496..512 step 4) and CE Epstein x^2 + 5y^2 (cap
  M = 640, rungs 624..640 step 4).  FIRE = [slow band destroyed:
  min of the 6 lowest eigenvalues < -THR_NULL = -1e-4 -- the band
  the reduction targets does not exist on indefinite data] OR
  [band-gap collapse: 6/7 rel gap < GAP_BAR] OR [Q-block resolvent
  collision at a gated z: min_{i>6} |lambda_i + eps| < 1e-8].
  Predeclared honesty: real-symmetric controls keep the abstract
  Herglotz identity (self-adjointness is not what the controls
  break), so Herglotz is NOT the discriminating clause here -- the
  slow-band/Q-separation clauses are; the negative-spectrum census
  is printed with each control.
VERDICT ENUM (frozen; decision order as listed):
  0. any guard fails or a control spuriously converges -> printed
     as FESHBACH-DEAD (invalid run), exit 1, no structural claim.
  1. FESHBACH-CONVERGES-d = the SMALLEST d in {6, 7, 8} passing
     GAP-d AND HERG-d AND REC-d AND CAUCHY-d: the infinite wall is
     now a d x d matrix limit; what remains for the boundary-triple
     module is stated plainly (the z -> 0 boundary transition of
     M~(z) = F~(z)^{-1} via Nevanlinna/Herglotz representation).
  2. FESHBACH-PARTIAL = no d passes all four, but at least one d
     passes the structural trio GAP+HERG+REC (the reduction is
     well-defined, the convergence bars are not met -- failing
     (d, gate) cells named with numbers).
  3. FESHBACH-DEAD = every d fails the structural trio, or a kill
     fires: the reduction route closes; the cell-cocycle module
     becomes the remaining path.
STOP-LIST (binding, inherited): no bare A^{-1} (every resolvent is
evaluated at the frozen z points with |z| >= 1e-3 or Im z = h,
never at z = 0); no PD-margin or 1/eps in any gate; no fits inside
gates beyond the declared bounded-statistic slopes; no Riemann
zeros; no target data; NO RH claim.  This probe writes no files.
Runtime cap 1200 s predeclared.

RESULTS (2026-08-05; verdict FESHBACH-PARTIAL, GATES 9/12,
GUARDS+CONTROLS 28/28, 24.4 s):
  *  DECLARED GUARD CORRECTION (honesty): the first execution
     (25.0 s) was invalidated SOLELY by a dimensionally wrong
     normalization of the G1.9 z-independence Ward -- the measured
     float deviation 1.5e-16 (machine-perfect for the exact shift
     identity) was compared against 1e-12 x the increment scale
     (2.7e-6) instead of 1e-12 x the block ENTRY scale (1e-2, the
     size of the entries being subtracted).  The Ward normalization
     was corrected, NO gate bar was touched, and the repeat run
     produced IDENTICAL gate outcomes (deterministic construction);
     both runs are reported here.
  *  THE REDUCTION IS WELL-DEFINED FOR d = 6 AND ONLY d = 6
     (structural trio GAP+HERG+REC): GAP-6 min rel gap 0.1008 at
     M = 1096 (top 0.1397, max 0.5592); HERG-6 max eig Im F~ =
     -1.000e-2 (= -h exactly, zero-coupling value), min eig
     Im F~^{-1} = +98.8; REC-6 max rel residual 8.8e-13 over 5
     rungs x 5 z-points (independent complex dense solves) -- the
     Feshbach identity reconstructs the slow resolvent corner at
     machine precision.  Coupling Ward max |E| = 3.1e-15..6.1e-15
     (P A Q = 0 measured); transport angles d = 6: <= 2.80 deg.
  *  BUT CAUCHY-6 FAILS -- on ONE clause, marginally: med5
     last/first = 0.206 <= 0.5 (a 5x fall of the increments,
     2.7e-6 -> 5e-7) yet the second-half rate b2 = +0.006/X <
     0.02: the tail FLATTENS and even ticks up at the last rungs
     (4.89e-7 -> 5.24e-7) -- exactly where the 7th mode brushes
     the band (gap minimum at M = 1096).
  *  THE MOVING-EDGE PICTURE (the run's structural finding): the
     band boundary is chased by the next descending mode at every
     d.  d = 7: CAUCHY-7 passes STRONGLY (med5 0.207, b2 =
     +0.502/X -- the 7-band transported block is genuinely
     falling) but GAP-7 fails exactly at the top rung (0.0613 at
     M = 1176, lam8 descending onto lam7 -- the same phenomenon
     one level up).  d = 8: an INTERNAL CROSSING -- gap 8/9
     collapses to 5.4e-4 at M = 976 with transport angle 87.2 deg
     (sigma_min 0.049, just above the 1e-8 kill floor: the
     crossing rotates the 8-band violently), then recovers to
     0.2653; CAUCHY-8 passes after the crossing but GAP-8 is
     dead.  No fixed d in {6, 7, 8} owns a uniformly separated
     band on 888..1176.
  *  Q-separation margins (fixed z, predeclared algebra (4)):
     min spec Q(A-z)Q = lambda_{d+1} + eps >= 1.081e-3 at the
     tightest gated cell (d = 6, eps = 1e-3; lambda_7 min
     8.068e-5); z -> 0-relevant floors lambda_7/8/9 min = 8.07e-5
     / 8.60e-5 / 1.17e-4.
  *  Step-1 sub-ladder (reported): increment exponents 0.99..1.01
     for all three d -- the effective-block path has smooth O(1)
     velocity; step refinement changes nothing (drainage-probe
     lesson confirmed on the matrix object).
  *  CONTROLS both fire on all rungs (slow band destroyed: min
     band eigenvalue -1.52e+4 scramble / -84.4 Epstein; gap
     clauses also break); Herglotz correctly NOT discriminating
     (predeclared).  GUARDS 28/28 including reproduction of the
     drainage run to 4 digits and lambda_min(1176) to 5e-10.
  *  CONSEQUENCE (stated plainly): the wall is NOT yet a finite
     matrix limit.  The d = 6 block is the right well-defined
     object (Herglotz + exact reconstruction + separated band) but
     its transported limit is blocked by the 7th mode grazing the
     band edge; the d = 7 block converges but is not yet a
     separated object at the top of the reachable ladder.  The
     boundary-triple module is NOT opened by this run.  What the
     moving-edge picture suggests (named, not probed): either a
     deeper comb to see whether the 7/8 edge separates again
     (letting d = 7 pass both), or a DEPTH-DEPENDENT band
     dimension d(X) with transition maps at the mode-entry rungs
     -- which is precisely the cell-cocycle module's territory:
     the remaining path of the offensive.  NO RH claim, no
     X -> infinity claim.

        experiments/tfpt-discovery/qf_feshbach_effective_probe.py

PART 2 -- qf_edge_separation_probe.py (docstring verbatim):
QF-OFFENSIVE strand 3, module 3 follow-up -- the deep-comb
edge-separation decider: does the 7/8 slow-band edge SEPARATE again
at greater depth (so that d = 7 owns a uniformly separated band on a
frozen tail of the new range AND passes the parent Cauchy bars -- the
fixed-d Feshbach limit exists after all), or does the edge KEEP
MOVING (new modes descending at a measurable cadence -- fixed-d is
closed on every reachable surface and the cell-cocycle formulation is
mandatory)?  qf_edge_separation_probe.

Exploration only (tfpt-experiment firewall): NOT wired into
run_all.py, no ledger row, no paper edit, no website edit, NO RH
CLAIM, and this probe writes no files.  It never reads a zero
ordinate and never evaluates the target before every source object is
built and SHA-256 frozen.  Band, transport, effective block and
census are built exclusively from the source window operator -- never
from target data.

INPUT STATE (frozen findings, none re-adjudicated here):
  *  qf_feshbach_effective_probe -- FESHBACH-PARTIAL on the 1e8 comb
     (X <= 18.375): the reduction is well-defined for d = 6 and ONLY
     d = 6 (GAP+HERG+REC), but CAUCHY-6 fails on the slope clause
     (b2 = +0.006 < 0.02) exactly where the 7th mode brushes the
     band; d = 7 passes CAUCHY strongly (med5 0.207, b2 = +0.502/X)
     but loses separation exactly at the top rung (gap 7/8 = 0.0613
     at M = 1176 < bar 0.10, lam8 descending); d = 8 has an internal
     8/9 crossing at M = 976 (transport angle 87.2 deg).  Its named
     next surface is exactly this probe: a deeper comb to see whether
     the 7/8 edge separates again (letting d = 7 pass both), vs a
     depth-dependent band dimension d(X) (the cocycle module).
  *  qf_drainage_probe -- QF-SETTLES-POSITIVE 14/14 on the 1e8 comb:
     settled per-function band weights (R2 family 0.225..0.358, R1
     family 0.008..0.079); 7th-mode threshold entry at M = 992,
     count 8 from M ~ 1108; 6/7 gap bottoms at 0.1008 (M ~ 1096..
     1100) then recovers to 0.1397 at 1176; single deep mode
     persists; lambda_min(1176) = 3.882e-6.
  *  Mode-entry record so far (X = M/64): 6th at M = 888
     (X = 13.875), 7th at M = 992 (X = 15.5), 8th at M ~ 1108
     (X ~ 17.3125) -- inter-entry gaps DX ~ 1.625, ~1.8125.  If this
     cadence is REGULAR, a new mode reaches every fixed band edge at
     bounded intervals and no fixed d separates permanently.

COMPUTE-BUDGET BENCHMARK (declared; run BEFORE this spec was frozen;
timing/memory only -- no spectra, no battery pairing, no gap or
census value was consulted): deployed sieve at 1e8 = 1.2 s / peak RSS
0.99 GB (reproduces the drainage declaration); 4e8 = 4.9 s / 4.5 GB;
1e9 = 12.3 s / 13.5 GB on a 512-GB machine; tent assembly rate
8.0e5 atoms/s -> ~62 s for the ~4.94e7 atoms in reach of X = 20.6875;
dense eigh at M ~ 1324 well under 0.5 s.  On this budget the deeper
cap is frozen at ATOM_MAX_XD = 1,000,000,000 (1e9) -- one cap, chosen
before the first run, never adjusted after.  M_CAP_XD =
floor(64 ln 1e9) = 1326; M_TOP_XD = 1324 (X = 20.6875; step-4 aligned
with the parent top: 1324 = 1176 + 37 x 4; sieve cover exp(20.6875)
+ 2 = 964,900,015 <= 1e9).  No rung thinning needed at this budget:
the full step-4 ladder 888..1324 (110 rungs) is kept.

FROZEN CONSTRUCTION (reused machinery verbatim, none invented):
  deep comb = deployed von Mangoldt generator (core.
      von_mangoldt_table) at cap ATOM_MAX_XD = 1e9; tower = continuum
      lags + atom tents on the dyadic grid D = 1/64
      (simpler_schur_recursion machinery verbatim).
  full ladder FLAD = 888..1324 step 4 (110 rungs, 109 increments;
      the leading 73 rungs 888..1176 are the Feshbach probe's GLAD,
      reused for exact continuity); census ladder CENS = [884] +
      FLAD (884 carries the entry-rung reproduction Ward);
      extension XLAD = 1180..1324 step 4 (37 rungs, X = 18.4375..
      20.6875); frozen tail block TAIL = last ceil(37/4) = 10
      extension rungs = 1288..1324 (X = 20.125..20.6875).
  band rule (parent rule verbatim): d LOWEST eigenmodes, always;
      threshold census #{lam <= THR_NULL = 1e-4} and deep census
      #{lam <= THR_DEEP = 1e-5} reported on every rung; q_f band
      weight uses the 6 LOWEST modes (drainage object, verbatim).
  d = 7 transported effective block (Feshbach machinery verbatim):
      sign-fixed 7 lowest eigenvectors, overlap S_k = V_{k+1}^T
      pad(V_k), polar factor of the SVD (floor sigma_min >= 1e-8
      else transport undefined = kill), chained R; F~_k(z) = R_k^T
      [Lambda_7(X_k) - z - C_7(z)] R_k with the MEASURED Schur
      correction C_7(z) = E_c^T diag(1/(lam_c - z)) E_c (machine
      scale, P A Q = 0 -- coupling Ward, never assumed); reference
      cell Z_REF = -1e-2 (the parent z-shift identity binds all
      other z cells to it -- redundant cells not re-evaluated);
      Herglotz certificates at ZC = (i h, -1e-3 + i h), h = 1e-2,
      on every FLAD rung (exact structural identity, checked as a
      guard-level Ward, not sold as evidence).
EDGE GATES (all frozen BEFORE the first run):
  EDGE-A  7/8 TAIL SEPARATION: rel gap g78 = (lam8 - lam7)/lam8 >=
      GAP_BAR = 0.10 on EVERY rung of the frozen TAIL block
      (recover above the bar and STAY there); the full g78 profile
      on FLAD, the first recovery rung on the extension, and the
      extension second-half linear trend are reported either way.
  EDGE-B  CAUCHY-7 DEEP (parent bars verbatim): increments delta_k
      = max-entry |F~_{k+1}(Z_REF) - F~_k(Z_REF)| over the 109
      FLAD increments; med5(LAST5)/med5(FIRST5) <= C_MED = 0.5 AND
      second-half falling rate b2 >= C_SLOPE = 0.02 per X unit
      (hbp.fit_rate verbatim); blocks FIRST5 = increments 1..5,
      LAST5 = 105..109, second half = 55..109.
  EDGE-C  MODE-DESCENT CADENCE (fit-free, reported AND gated as the
      keeps-moving clause): entry rung of mode n = first CENS rung
      with threshold count >= n; inter-entry gaps DX_n in X; frozen
      regularity statistic rel spread (max DX - min DX)/max DX <=
      CAD_BAR = 0.25 over all measured consecutive gaps; the
      keeps-moving clause KM2 FIRES iff a NEW entry (count >= 9)
      occurs on the extension AND the cadence is regular.  No fit
      enters any gate; the predicted next-entry depth X_last +
      mean(DX) is REPORTED only.
  Also reported, never gated: gap 6/7 and 8/9 profiles on the
      extension (does the d = 6 grazing resolve? where does the 9th
      mode press?); settled q_f levels med5 over the new TOP5 =
      1308..1324 vs the drainage TOP5 = 1160..1176 (drainage
      confirmation for free); PD margins.

CONTROLS (mandatory, must fire; fire rule = qf_spectral_bundle_probe.
  control_bundle VERBATIM, imported read-only): CS position scramble
  (positions uniform in (0.5, 2 alpha_xd), masses kept, seed 7, on
  the 1e9 comb, rungs 496..512 step 4) and CE Epstein x^2 + 5y^2
  (epstein_firewall_probe read-only, cap M = 640, rungs 624..640
  step 4).  FIRE = rank instability OR gap collapse OR angle
  saturation.  A control whose bundle construction stays intact has
  spuriously converged: the run is INVALID.
VERDICT ENUM (frozen; decision order as listed):
  0. any guard fails or a control spuriously converges -> the run is
     INVALID: printed as EDGE-UNDECIDED (invalid run), exit 1, no
     edge statement follows.
  1. EDGE-SEPARATES-D7 = EDGE-A passes AND EDGE-B passes: the 7/8
     edge separates again at depth and the transported d = 7 block
     is Cauchy at the parent bars -- the fixed-d Feshbach limit
     exists after all; the boundary-triple module reopens with
     d = 7.
  2. EDGE-KEEPS-MOVING = (EDGE-A fails) OR (KM2 fires: a new mode
     entry on the extension at regular cadence): the band edge is
     chased by descending modes at the measured cadence -- fixed-d
     is closed on every reachable surface and the cell-cocycle
     formulation is the remaining path; the cadence (mean DX, rel
     spread) is stated as the new named structural constant.
  3. otherwise EDGE-UNDECIDED: the bars are not reached either way
     (e.g. tail separates but the Cauchy tail is too short, and no
     new entry adjudicates the cadence); the deciding depth is
     stated honestly.
STOP-LIST (binding, inherited): no target decomposition / Cholesky /
zeros anywhere; no bare A^{-1} (resolvents only at the frozen z with
|z| >= 1e-3 or Im z = h); no PD-margin or 1/eps in any gate; no fits
inside gates beyond the declared bounded-statistic slope (b2, parent
CAUCHY clause verbatim; the cadence gate is fit-free); no Riemann
zeros; NO RH claim.  This probe writes no files.  Runtime cap 1800 s
predeclared.

RESULTS (2026-08-05, first and only preregistered run, 160.3 s;
GATES: EDGE-A FAIL, EDGE-B PASS, KM2 quiet; GUARDS+CONTROLS 20/20;
verdict EDGE-KEEPS-MOVING, carried by the EDGE-A failure alone):
  *  THE 7/8 EDGE DOES NOT SEPARATE -- IT CLOSES INTO A NEAR-
     CROSSING.  On the extension the 7/8 gap NEVER reaches the bar
     again (extension max 0.0568, right after the parent top): from
     0.0613 at M = 1176 it falls through 0.0209 (M = 1208) to
     0.0039 at M = 1240 (printed profile; an avoided crossing --
     lam8 descends THROUGH the 7-band edge), relaxes to ~0.011,
     and decays again to 0.0074 at the top rung 1324.  At the top
     the pair is nearly degenerate: lam7 = 7.9351e-5, lam8 =
     7.9946e-5 (and lam9 = 9.1935e-5 -- modes 7/8/9 now form a
     CLUSTER below thr 1e-4).  The transport sees the crossing:
     min sigma_min = 0.0271 (max angle 88.45 deg, still above the
     1e-8 kill floor -- the same violent band rotation the parent
     measured for d = 8 at M = 976, now one level down).  EDGE-A
     min tail gap 0.0074 < 0.10: FAIL, unambiguous.
  *  EDGE-B PASSES CLEANLY EVEN THROUGH THE CROSSING: the
     transported 7x7 block stays Cauchy on all 109 increments --
     2.72e-6 -> 3.94e-7, med5 last/first = 0.181 <= 0.5, b2 =
     +0.061/X >= 0.02 (parent 1e8 numbers were 0.207 / +0.502).
     The moving-edge picture is now measured at two consecutive
     levels: every d gets a CONVERGENT transported block and then
     loses its edge to the next descending mode.  Convergence was
     never the problem; band ownership is.
  *  MODE-DESCENT CADENCE (the fit-free record): entries at
     M = 888 / 992 / 1108 / 1276 (X = 13.8750 / 15.5000 / 17.3125
     / 19.9375) -- the 9th mode enters INSIDE the extension.
     Inter-entry gaps DX = 1.6250 / 1.8125 / 2.6250, mean 2.0208,
     rel spread 0.381 > CAD_BAR 0.25: the frozen KM2 clause does
     NOT fire -- the cadence is real but NOT regular at the frozen
     bar; the spacing WIDENS with depth (third gap 1.6x the
     first).  That widening is the honest surprise of this run and
     the number the cocycle module must carry.  Predicted next
     entry at the measured mean cadence (REPORTED only): X ~ 21.96
     (M ~ 1405, ATOM_MAX ~ 3.4e9).  Deep count (lam <= 1e-5)
     stays exactly 1 on all 111 census rungs.
  *  THE d = 6 GRAZING RESOLVES (reported): the 6/7 gap recovers
     from the parent's 0.1008 bottom to 0.4333 at the top rung
     (extension min 0.1444 at M = 1180) -- at X = 20.6875 the
     separated object is the 6-band again, sitting under a 7/8/9
     cluster.  gap 8/9 extension min 0.1304 (at the top, falling).
     Together with EDGE-A this is the moving-edge picture in full:
     the band boundary d(X) is 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 by threshold count
     but the SEPARATED dimension oscillates (6 separated here,
     7/8/9 clustered) -- no fixed d owns the tail.
  *  q_f DRAINAGE CONFIRMATION FOR FREE: the settled levels hold
     to 0.87..1.09x over 2.3 more X units -- med5(1308..1324) vs
     med5(1160..1176): R2 family 0.3245/0.2948/0.2809/0.2247/
     0.2015 vs 0.3583/0.3370/0.3127/0.2590/0.2249; R1 family
     0.0735/0.0761/0.0599/0.0089.  Typed honestly: extension fall
     rates b = +0.050..+0.083/X sit slightly ABOVE the drainage
     plateau bar 0.05 (reported here, never gated) -- a mild
     renewed decline worth one line in any future drainage rerun,
     far from the Z-type collapse (levels >= 0.0089).  PD margins
     (measured, never gated): lambda_min 3.882e-6 (1176) ->
     2.455e-6 (1324).
  *  CONTROLS both fire (rank + gap clauses): CS scramble (1e9
     comb, 49,154,321 atoms) threshold counts 242..253 vs 6,
     253/512 negative, min rel gap 0.0006; CE Epstein counts
     251..263 vs 6, min rel gap 0.0650.  GUARDS 20/20: deep-table
     overlap exact (dev 0.0), kappa = 0.038821 unchanged on
     [100, 1e9], prefix Ward 2.0e-14, ALL anchors reproduced --
     gaps 0.1008/0.1397/0.0613 to 4 digits, lambda_min(1176) dev
     5e-10, entry rungs 884:5 / 888:6 / 992:7th exact, all nine
     drainage levels dev <= 4.9e-5; coupling Ward 4.1e-15,
     transport orthogonality 9.6e-14, HERG-7 Ward exact (-1.000e-2
     / +98.57), boundedness clean; runtime 160.3 s <= 1800 s.
  *  CONSEQUENCE FOR THE OFFENSIVE (stated plainly): FIXED-d IS
     CLOSED on every reachable surface -- not by non-convergence
     (CAUCHY-7 passes at 1e8 and again at 1e9, straight through an
     avoided crossing) but by band ownership: d = 7 never regains
     a separated edge (tail gap 0.0074 vs bar 0.10) because lam8
     crosses INTO the 7-band on the extension, exactly as lam7 had
     grazed the 6-band one window earlier.  The boundary-triple
     module does NOT reopen with d = 7.  The CELL-COCYCLE
     formulation -- depth-dependent band dimension d(X) with
     transition maps at the mode-entry rungs -- is the only
     remaining path of the diagonal route; its cell boundaries are
     the measured entry rungs 888 / 992 / 1108 / 1276, its
     per-cell blocks are convergent objects (EDGE-B), and its
     structural constant is the measured, WIDENING entry cadence
     DX = 1.625 / 1.8125 / 2.625 (mean 2.02, spread 0.381 -- NOT
     regular at the frozen 0.25 bar; whether DX grows like a
     deterministic law is a question for that module, stated not
     fitted).  Additional cocycle input from this run: the
     separated dimension at the top is 6 again under a 7/8/9
     cluster -- cells may carry CLUSTERS, not single modes.  NOT
     claimed: any statement beyond X = 20.6875, eps-uniformity,
     RH.
