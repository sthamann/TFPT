          An external note asked: what if primes are not the origin but the{" "}

          arithmetic? The checkable core of that reading is exact, on the
          compiler&apos;s own objects. The E₈ theta function, computed from

          The “address space” reading is unique factorization, exactly (shell
          counts factor over coprime addresses; the must-fail control shows
          non-coprime does not). The “independent check channels” reading is

          tower gap, and by Guinand the comb&apos;s sqrt-scale

          exists, the identified corner&apos;s excess is positive

          the forced Cauchy–Schwarz price and the price is
          geometry-independent (the unitary spectral mother gains

            never assumed). The honest typing is frozen and non-negotiable:
            W1 and W2 are <em>algorithmically independent evaluations of the

            two independent proofs; positivity is certified on a finite

            grows as T_req ~ h^2.8, and its ratio to the window&apos;s own

            signature: verdict WALLPAPER, the route buried by its own

            one global fixed eight-pole rational filter certifies all 68
            ladder steps (per-rung optimum three to five poles), compressing

            values, with the honest caveat that the filter&apos;s
            observer-complexity grade sits far above the half-gap class.

                There is one quantity in this story that must never go negative.
                It is assembled out of the prime numbers, one prime at a time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Picture a bridge built span by span. Each new span has to carry
                the load the previous one can no longer hold. Each prime is a
                span. The handover from one span to the next is the whole
                question: does it keep working, prime after prime, without end?

              <p>
                If it does, a classical statement called{" "}

                holds — and that statement is equivalent to the Riemann
                Hypothesis. So this is where the difficulty of the Riemann
                question actually sits, in the form the diary can touch. We do
                not prove it. We test the relay span by span, and we write down
                precisely what a proof would still need.

        After the T102–T176 sprint (its identity cores promoted module by
        module), what remains TFPT-specific is exactly one object: I5 — and the
        induction that would carry it is now
        a conditional theorem, assembled end to end on 52 zones (T125), whose
        load-bearing spine is 96.2% identity or Cholesky certificate, whose only
        hypothesis is a declared accounting convention, and whose seam
        architecture is finished (T126): both remaining inequalities are
        proof-shaped (T127), three of the four resulting points stand at their
        preregistered bars (T128 · THREE-OF-FOUR), the kappa law that T128
        preregistered falls once on 331 fresh transports while the theorem
        underneath it stands (T129 · KAPPA-WILD), the graded-to-uniform
        bridge stands as an identity — 84 pairs, zero overshoot, both deep
        seams carried to positive fine floors — while the curvature bound is
        reduced to a uniform bound on one exponent (T130 · ONE-OF-TWO), and
        the self-supply loop is built one number short of closed: the
        epsilon-to-floor sandwich and sign constancy via Perron–Frobenius
        are theorems, and M25 reduces to positivity of the pole-free
        section with nine decades of slack (T131 · SUPPLY-PARTIAL). The phase
        then reversed direction: that identity block is now load-bearing v542
        (nine per-instance identities and theorems, nothing uniform), the
        Beurling–Deny triad became an operator discriminator for the seam DtN
        (T132 · SPECTRUM-ONLY), and a certificate audit hardened v379 to an
        exact positive-mixture Gram certificate (T133 · MIXED). T134 (PARTIAL)
        then closed the existence half of the pole-free floor — all Cholesky
        pivots positive on 79/79 windows, every cheap lower-bound route
        failing by sign, not size, with the one surviving opening named (an
        M-matrix question) — and T135 (BOUNDED-STATE) found the bounded
        faithful seam state the Weil window provably lacks (m_cert = 12, from
        the pre-declared set, with the honest caveats stated). T136
        (ONE-CARRIES) then closed one item of that M-matrix question outright —
        Varga&apos;s regular splitting makes the Jacobi radius an identity and
        Collatz–Wielandt bounds it a priori, sharp to 1.00–1.03 on 900/900 — with
        the exact bookkeeping putting the whole degradation in the margin and M17
        closing negatively; and T137 (BOTH-RESIST) made the long-lag support an
        explicit arithmetic stripe set and certified the entire absolute-value
        envelope family DEAD (ρ(|E|) ≥ 1.32 from below on 35/35), leaving one
        named residue: a sign-preserving bound. Thirteen of those statements are
        now load-bearing as v543 and v544.

          The first post-series probe (T126 · SEAMS-CERTIFIED, 31/31)
          finished the seam architecture and left exactly two genuinely new
          inequalities — the direction lemma (U3) and the zone-uniform seam
          floor (U5). The phase then worked them down round by round
          (T127–T176), promoted every identity core module by module
          (v542–v562), and closed its measurement programme as planned:
          R1 stands classified as a near-degeneracy, not a size. The full
          phase-2 narrative — every probe, every honest break — is
          preserved verbatim behind the expander. Sandbox; not RH evidence.
