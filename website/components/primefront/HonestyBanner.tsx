          The sprint T102–T125
          compressed the remaining arithmetic bound to one sign plus one declared
          accounting convention; phase 2 (T126–T176) closed its measurement
          programme as planned and stands as a certified map with one open
          object (R1, classified as a near-degeneracy, not a size). Since then
          the diary runs as backflow rounds: the uniform constant C = 1,
          exception-free on the complete surface (v618/v619); the Lorentz
          congruence identifying the prime determinant form with the cover
          polarization lattice, and the Hodge chamber it buys (v624/v627,
          v635–v637); E₈ as a literal error-correcting code with a
          compiler-native bit dictionary (v626/v638); the sixty-line reflection
          group G31 with the order-coincidence numerology killed (v633/v634);
          and the Suzuki W1 identification — atom layer literal, smooth layer
          derived, portable and closed at the matrix level (v630/v631,
          v640–v642), then corrected by a same-day erratum and proved as a
          measure-level theorem (v643: Suzuki&apos;s eq. (1.3) carries Lerch
          +1/4, not −1; every measured number transfers verbatim, the true
          dictionary is the single scalar +1/D with κ = 0), with W2 started
          (v644) and the W3 sign-uncertainty toolbox typed as not
          transferring at d = 1 (v648). Honest fence: closing W1 does not
          move W3 (uniform positivity, the RH-hard step). No claim of
          progress toward the Riemann Hypothesis is made.
