  },
  {
    heading: "Geometry first (0:17)",
    body: "The TFPT builds the E8 lattice from two axioms. Its counting function already knows the primes: each one acts as its own Hecke check channel. And the zeta function appears as a shadow of this geometry.",
  },
  {
    heading: "The W1 theorem (0:31)",
    body: "From this bookkeeping came a window matrix. And it turned out to be something classical: word for word, Suzuki's localized Weil operator. That is the W1 theorem — machine-verified, with one honestly documented erratum.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Detector & falsifier (0:46)",
    body: "The same window form is a detector. Calibrated on solved worlds: Ramanujan graphs — where the analogue is proven — pass the test. Epstein zeta functions — with genuine zeros off the line — break it, exactly as predicted. And the matched filter makes this constructive: any off-line zero would produce a computable witness. The object is falsifiable.",

    heading: "Two surface theorems (1:10)",

    heading: "The Ihara blueprint (1:29)",
    body: "Then, August third: in the graph laboratory, where the analogue is proven, the target decomposition exists exactly — a sum of squares plus a defect. Our window form is built identically. One part is missing: the engine, Z1. Hilbert–Pólya, in window coordinates.",
  },
  {
    heading: "The measure from the geometry (1:48)",
    body: "And the geometry supplies the measure: the prime atoms can be read off, without circularity, from lattice counting alone. The gamma flow forces their masses to per mille — and their positions. But honestly: as a test bench, not as a generator.",
  },
  {
    heading: "The corridor and the 0.53 (2:04)",
    body: "The state today: every mass lives in a corridor with exactly computable edges. The arithmetic does not choose the edge — it chooses an interior point, at zero point five three. An energy extremum hits it to within per mille. The open question: explain the selection inside the corridor.",
