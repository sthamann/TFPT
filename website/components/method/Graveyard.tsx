      "The sixty-line reflection group has order 46080 = 1920 · 24 — exactly the product of the two compiler Weyl groups. It looked like the glue theorem written as group theory.",
    died:
      "Killed three ways: G31 is not isomorphic to the product (centers 4 vs 1), is no direct or semidirect product in either order (Lagrange kill), and W(D₅) does not even embed in any rank-4 unitary group. The order coincidence carries no structure.",

      "The anchor's power sums looked like they might be literal code operations in the Reed–Muller dictionary — 'the compiler numbers are code words'.",
    died:
      "0/11 natural code families reproduce the sequence; 18, 27, 81 have no code reading at all. The bingo is buried in public; only the σ-selected anchor decomposition survives as an exact statement.",

    title: "The compiler clock as a square: c = w²",
    tempting:
      "The regular 24-element w satisfies w⁶ = ±J, so the order-12 compiler clock looked like its square — one clock, one origin.",
    died:
      "Killed by a parity theorem: 12-cycles of any square arise in pairs from 24-cycles, and the clock's census 19×12 + 3×4 has odd counts — impossible even in S₂₄₀. A power-census scan over all 46080 elements confirms it.",

    title: "Fine Hodge invariants ↔ the C = 1 margin",
    tempting:
      "Raw correlations of ±0.40 suggested the fine geometric invariants of the prime front predict the arithmetic contraction margin — a geometry-to-primes bridge.",
    died:
      "After controlling for the ladder parameter h, the partial correlation is ρ = −0.040 (p = 0.75) — the raw signal was entirely the h-trend. Promoted as an honest negative; the bridge, if it exists, needs a different functional.",

    title: "The naive 48 × 5 incidence on the E₈ roots",
    tempting:
      "240 = 48 · 5 — the seam sites times the carrier slots. An external review proposed building the roots canonically as (cover modes) × (carrier slots).",
    died:
      "The canonical order-12 element does not act freely (census 19×12 + 3×4, not 20 free orbits) — the construction fails at the first hurdle. The positive residue is sharp and smaller: the μ₄ clock alone acts freely with exactly 60 orbits.",

    title: "The external review's B-test",
    tempting:
      "A follow-up test proposed by an external review looked like an independent check of the anchor bytecode.",

      "The W1 dictionary chain read Suzuki's screw function with Lerch coefficient −1; four modules and a two-layer dictionary were built on that reading.",
    died:
      "Self-found and corrected the same day: the paper's own data lock +1/4. Every measured number transfers verbatim via an exact identity; the dictionary collapses to one scalar. Documented as dated erratum blocks across modules, ledger, papers and site.",
