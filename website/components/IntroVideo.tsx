  {
    heading: "Compiler (0:00)",
    body: "What if the laws of nature are not a list of fitted constants but the output of a tiny compiler? Topological Fixed-Point Theory begins with two declared axioms. The boundary constant c₃ equals one over eight pi and a five slot carrier. From them, it builds D₅ plus A₃, joins the two through a cyclic μ₄ glue and reaches E₈. Then it reads off the discrete standard model structure, the gauge group, three families, hypercharges, and the flavor operators together with dimensionless fixed point readouts. The claim is not that every physical detail is solved, it is narrower and testable. A small machine constructs a large rigid skeleton then names every bridge it still needs.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Alpha fixed point (0:39)",
    body: "The flagship line is alpha inverse, 137.0359992168. The verifier finds it as the unique positive stationary root of the boundary U(1) Ward identity. It is not fitted to the measured value, mutate the permitted terms and the root does not survive. E₈ is the checksum behind the discrete construction, 240 roots lock the D₅ and A₃ sectors into one even, unimodular rank eight lattice. At the time of this recording, 1012 machine-checked verification modules tested this architecture, its numerical identities, its reductions and its failures; the live total is shown on the verification page. Every load-bearing claim has a script and a claim identifier. The status ledger, not the rhetoric, decides whether a line is exact, conditional, open or a kill test.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Dual status (1:23)",
    body: "That discipline forces two status cards to sit side by side. The first is the compiler rest. It has three named interfaces. v_geo, the one dimensionful calibration that pure numbers cannot supply. G_net, the seam-to-E₈ net identification, conditionally closed on its MMST route, but open as an unconditional parent claim. And F_transfer, the typed interfaces that carry selected compiler structures into masses, QCD, baryogenesis and cosmology. Beside it sits a stricter card, the physical theory of everything rest. Its master contract is the AND of eight gates. None is fully closed. They demand the seam continuum, a complete three plus one dimensional local quantum theory, a chiral measure and uniform mirror gap, controlled infrared physics, internally fixed couplings and neutrino dynamics, emergent gravity and the physical state. So the honest sentence is precise. TFPT closes a discrete compiler. It does not yet certify a strict physical theory of everything.",
  },
  {
    heading: "August structural wave (2:20)",
    body: "The August wave did not erase that frontier. It compressed it. First, the seam boundary theory was reduced to one external charged scaling limit theorem. Five supporting lemmas were proved in-house. The cross product step, a uniform growth bound, the first telescoping estimate, the integer D₅ plus A₃ pairings and the order-four outer action. The remaining analytic target is isolated in a 20 plus page memorandum and a send-ready specialist package. Second, the DET16 mirror mechanism is exact on the full 2¹⁶ cluster. A rank one projector, a gap exactly equal to one and all 45 Spin(10) commutators vanishing. A cited stability theorem now supplies a volume uniform finite chain leg. The full dynamical four-dimensional claim remains conditional. Third, the first 3+1-dimensional lattice scaffold now lets gauge content, a chiral wall mirror gapping and the seam clock coexist. The Hamiltonian-class dynamics has a Lieb–Robinson bound, a norm-convergent time evolution, a gauge-invariant quasilocal algebra and ground and thermal states. Phase uniqueness, the limiting gap and infrared universality remain open. Finally, the finite axiom core premises now derive in-house. The remainder is zero modulo the same external MMST identification. P2 remains typed as an axiom and the genuine four-dimensional functional is still a gate. The gain is not a victory slogan, it is convergence. Many vague gaps have become one external theorem, one physical unit and a short list of explicit four-dimensional obligations.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Falsification (3:51)",
    body: "A serious compiler must also record what does not compile. The number-preserving Casimir projector does not isolate the mirror state, its multiplicities explode instead. Eight preregistered Schur-texture constructions all fail because the even seam data forces the wrong degeneracy and the naive extension of the alpha grammar to the strong and weak couplings fails in all 64 tested conventions while the U(1) control survives. These routes are not quietly deleted, they become permanent constraints. The future mechanism must evade the exact reason each one died. That is how the project protects itself from numerology. A failed pattern is evidence, not decoration.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Predictions (4:29)",
    body: "The newest neutrino chain shows how the live frontier is meant to work. As a candidate, it gives a normal-ordering mass sum near 0.0599 electron volts, a leptonic CP phase near 287.7 degrees and a pentagon-class misalignment with phase 288 degrees and angle two pi over 35. At finite level, all three mixing angles land within 0.56 sigma. But the mechanism that turns the seam operator into the flavor operator is still open. There is no seesaw closure. The labels stay candidate and numerical, not exact physics. DESI can press on the mass floor. DUNE can separate 287.7 degrees from the older 240 degree branch. JUNO can test the reactor-angle structure. So is reality compiled? We still do not know. What exists now is more disciplined than an answer by proclamation. A machine-checked compiler with a sharpened map of what remains. Every closed line has a proof object. Every gap has a name. Every prediction has a kill switch.",
